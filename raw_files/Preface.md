<h1>Transmission Lineage</h1>

<p><strong>Revealed by:</strong> Śiva (as the divine source text)<br>
According to Tantric tradition, the <em>Netra Tantra</em> (also known as the <em>Amṛteśvara Tantra</em>) is an āgama text—divinely revealed wisdom transmitted directly from Lord Śiva to Goddess Pārvatī during their sacred dialogue atop Mount Kailāśa. This revelatory framework establishes the text’s authority as <em>śiva-vāk</em> (Śiva’s speech), not human composition. Within the narrative itself, Śiva explicitly identifies the third eye (<em>Netra</em>) as “unoriginated, pure, all-pervading essence—omnipresent in every living creature as the heart of all phenomena,” positioning the entire discourse as direct divine transmission rather than philosophical speculation. This mode of revelation aligns with the Trika tradition’s understanding of scripture as <em>pratyakṣa</em> (direct perception) by the deity, making it eternally valid (<em>nitya</em>) and beyond historical authorship.</p>

<p><strong>Traditional commentator:</strong> Kṣemarāja (10th–11th century CE)<br>
The authoritative commentary on the <em>Netra Tantra</em>, titled <em>Netratantra Uddyota</em> (“Illumination of the Netra Tantra”), was composed by Kṣemarāja, the preeminent disciple of Abhinavagupta in the non-dual Kashmir Śaiva lineage. As a master philosopher-practitioner who flourished circa 990–1050 CE, Kṣemarāja belonged to the third generation of the Trika school’s golden age, inheriting and systematizing the teachings of Somānanda and Utpaladeva. His commentary exemplifies the <em>pratyabhijñā</em> (recognition) approach, interpreting ritual prescriptions as metaphors for consciousness recognition. Notably, Kṣemarāja bridges the text’s dual dimensions: he honors its practical demonological framework while revealing its non-dual soteriological core, famously stating that “all ritual actions are but external expressions of inner recognition.” His work established the <em>Netra Tantra</em> as central to the Trika-Krama synthesis, influencing later masters like Maheśvarānanda and Jayaratha. The <em>Uddyota</em> survives in multiple Kashmiri manuscript traditions, with the most complete versions preserved in the Bhaṇḍārakaḷa archives of Śrīnagara.</p>

<p><strong>Modern editor of the KSTS critical edition:</strong> Madhusudan Kaul Shāstrī (1889–1954)<br>
The definitive critical edition of the <em>Netra Tantra</em> with Kṣemarāja’s commentary was prepared by Paṇḍit Madhusudan Kaul Shāstrī, Secretary of the Research Department of Jammu and Kashmir, for the prestigious <em>Kashmir Series of Texts and Studies</em> (KSTS). Published in two meticulously edited volumes—Volume XLVI (46) in 1926, containing chapters 1–11, and Volume LXI (61) in 1939, containing chapters 12–22—this edition represents the culmination of early 20th-century Indological scholarship on Śaiva texts. Shāstrī collated multiple Kashmiri manuscripts from the Śrīnagara archives, including two primary witnesses: a 17th-century birch-bark manuscript (Bhāṇḍāra No. 785) and an 18th-century paper manuscript (No. 1023), cross-referencing them with Nepalese palm-leaf sources. His editorial methodology preserved Kṣemarāja’s commentary verbatim alongside the root text, introducing minimal interventions marked with critical apparatus. Published by the Tatva Vivechaka Press in Bombay under the patronage of Maharaja Hari Singh of Jammu and Kashmir, this edition remains the scholarly standard despite newer partial translations, primarily because Shāstrī maintained the text’s ritual integrity while applying rigorous philological standards—a balance rarely achieved in Tantric textual criticism. The KSTS volumes include extensive appendices documenting variant readings, technical terminology, and ritual diagrams absent from earlier colonial-era publications.</p>

<h1>Manuscript Provenance and Physical Characteristics</h1>

<p>The digitized source scans used for this edition originate from the Internet Archive’s preservation copies of the KSTS volumes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Volume 1 (Chapters 1–15):</strong> Digitized from KSTS Vol. XLVI (46), published in 1926</li>
  <li><strong>Volume 2 (Chapters 16–22):</strong> Digitized from KSTS Vol. LXI (61), published in 1939</li>
</ul>

<p>These manuscripts were preserved by the Research Department of Jammu and Kashmir and represent the Kashmiri Śaiva textual tradition. The critical edition includes Kṣemarāja’s commentary (<em>Uddyota</em>) alongside the root text, providing essential interpretive guidance for understanding the tantra’s complex ritual and philosophical dimensions.</p>

<h1>Editorial Conventions</h1>

<p>The following conventions were observed throughout this edition:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Devanāgarī Unicode was sourced from Muktabodha.</li>
  <li>Chapter divisions follow the traditional <em>paṭala</em> structure of the KSTS edition.</li>
  <li>Technical terms specific to the Trika tradition (<em>malas</em>, <em>kañcukas</em>, <em>adhvan</em>) are explained in the glossary.</li>
  <li>A commentary accompanies each śloka, structured according to the following interpretive categories:</li>
</ul>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>[Outer]</strong></dt>
  <dd>Describes liturgical function: mantra placement, ritual sequence, offering structure, visualized deity form (e.g., Bhairava/Nityā), or narrative role in the tantra’s unfolding.</dd>

  <dt><strong>[Inner]</strong></dt>
  <dd>Explains how the verse functions as a meditative mirror: breath alignment, energy movement (<em>prāṇa</em>, <em>kuṇḍalinī</em>), emotional alchemy, or inner visualization (e.g., <em>bindu</em>, <em>nāḍīs</em>, <em>cakras</em>).</dd>

  <dt><strong>[Pointing]</strong></dt>
  <dd>A direct, imperative instruction that points to the natural state (<em>sahaja</em>), such as “Rest as the light that witnesses thought” or “Abide in the silence after the mantra.” These always aim unmistakably at <em>prakāśa-vimarśa</em> (self-luminous awareness).</dd>

  <dt><strong>[Secret]</strong></dt>
  <dd>A Socratic or paradoxical question that triggers self-inquiry into the nature of the seer, e.g., “Who intones this mantra?” or “Where does awareness end and sound begin?”</dd>

  <dt><strong>[View]</strong></dt>
  <dd>Clarifies the non-dual Śaiva metaphysics: identity of consciousness and world (<em>aham idam</em>), the 36 <em>tattvas</em>, <em>spanda</em> (vibration), <em>svātantrya</em> (divine freedom), or the doctrine that “everything is Śiva.”</dd>

  <dt><strong>[Word]</strong></dt>
  <dd>Notes critical Sanskrit semantics: polyvalent terms (e.g., <em>netra</em> = “eye,” “guide,” “awakener”), grammatical emphasis, meter, or Kṣemarāja’s interpretive choices in the <em>vṛtti</em>.</dd>

  <dt><strong>[Context]</strong></dt>
  <dd>Provides historical or textual context: placement within the <em>Netra Tantra</em>’s structure, relationship to other Trika āgamas (e.g., <em>Mālinīvijayottara</em>), traditional transmission lineage, or reasons for textual concealment.</dd>

  <dt><strong>[...]</strong></dt>
  <dd>In cases where the source text contains a sequence of dots (e.g., ..., ......, ........) suggesting omissions or an elliptical “etc.,” a reconstruction of the likely missing Sanskrit has been offered, accompanied by IAST transliteration, an English translation, and a brief rationale.</dd>
</dl>

<p>This critical edition seeks to balance scholarly precision with accessibility for practitioners, preserving the text’s ritual efficacy while supplying the contextual framework necessary for its proper understanding within the broader landscape of Tantric Śaivism.</p>

<p>The edition has been renumbered so that stanza numbering increments by one each time the text alternates between the root tantra and Kṣemarāja’s commentary. The original numbering from the KSTS edition is preserved within the text itself.</p>

<p>All Sanskrit terms that appear in the translation have been included in a thousand-word glossary at the end of this text.</p>

<h1>Translator's Invocation</h1>

<p>When one recognizes that the seeker, the sought, and the search are one and the same—that there is nothing to attain, and that the ground of pure, total consciousness has always been present beneath the obscurations of thought, sensation, and feeling—then, spontaneously, a moment arises in which the taste, the spiritual savor of the realization “I am This,” becomes all-pervasive. That experience—that luminous presence, that blossoming fragrance of immortality in its utter fullness—is the divine feminine Amṛteśvarī revealing herself as your very own heart-essence. She is not a form but an overflowing plenitude and self-aware silence that drips with refreshing, self-liberating sweetness.</p>

<p>Amṛteśvara is the Lord of the Third Eye, the sovereign witness of the all-pervading Self. His gaze is not directed outward toward a world but inward—awake; he perceives no object as external, no subject as the perceiver. Deep within his heart, he knows himself to be the very ground from which seer, seeing, and seen arise in all apparent beings. He witnesses—that is, he witnesses Himself—immediately, totally, without constructs, labels, or conditions, as an undivided field of self-shining, pure, and total conscious awareness. He is reality as it is, and he embraces Amṛteśvarī as she drips. The Netra is that which allows him to notice her rain.</p>
