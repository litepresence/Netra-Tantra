Twenty-Second Chapter
Neṭrodyotaḥ: The Illumination of the Eye

That which the fire of supreme Śiva emits,  
destroying duality, sprinkling everything with the essence of the supreme nectar that flashes forth,  
and manifests the vibration that is oneness of light and bliss—  
we praise that supreme Eye of Śarva, lord of all the followers, the indescribable!  

Although begun in the previous chapter, in the middle it became mixed with endless subjects—

To resolve the essence of mantras…

The blessed Goddess spoke:

# 2

Countless millions of mantras there are, of boundless splendour—
proclaimed by the Lord as all-knowing, all-pervading, ever-auspicious. || 21 ||
All of them are sovereign over all, worthy of worship, authoritative everywhere.
Yet how can one among these very same mantras be supremely more powerful? || 22-1 ||
How can the King of Mantras, the Supreme Lord, be the supreme Mr̥tyuñjaya?
A doubt has arisen in my heart—O Lord, please resolve it for me. || 22-2 ||
How was the real nature of the previously declared mantras obscured from me by the Lord?
Today I wish to hear that; great is my curiosity. || 22-3 ||

# 3

O Lord who dwells in the heart, O Lord of the heart, O my own Self!
All millions of mantras have been declared by You in the scriptures as possessing lesser or greater greatness.
Therefore the doubt has arisen in me: “How is this King of Mantras superior?”
Hence speak the decisive word, declare it!
For the real nature of the mantras declared earlier—abounding in manifold authorities and rendered variegated by numerous teachings—has, as it were, been snatched away from me.
With a mind that seizes the essence I now desire to comprehend it.
In this matter which is the essence of all essences, my curiosity is extreme. || 22-4 ||

Thus questioned by the Goddess, Bhairava spoke:

# 4

Listen! I shall now expound the doubt that abides in your heart.

# 5

“Expounding” here means “decisive resolution.”

Therefore He says:

# 6

Countless millions of mantras exist—all are fully authoritative. || 4 ||
They are the very effulgence of Śiva-Śakti, endowed with all powers.
All of them bestow enjoyment and liberation, augmented by the strength of their own Śakti. || 22-5 ||

# 7

Although they are thus magnified by the power and autonomy that belong to Śiva who is their own Self,
nevertheless there exists a special distinction in this Lord of Mantras—thus He begins to explain:

# 8

Yet the supreme Lord is tranquil, possessed of immeasurable qualities.
Śiva is all-formed, pure, to be grasped only by direct realisation, unsurpassed. || 22-6 ||
He is the supreme resort of all these mantras, the all-pervasive Supreme Lord.

# 9

The Lord (deva) is that reality which illuminates, etc.; He is supreme (para) because He is the Absolute; tranquil (śānta) because duality is stilled in Him; possessed of immeasurable qualities such as non-dual omniscience, etc.; all-formed because He has integrated both duality and non-duality into the supreme non-dual state; pure because even while being the one Self of the universe He remains unoccluded; to be grasped only by direct realisation because He is a mass of consciousness self-luminous by His own light.
He is the resort of these mantras which, though manifested by Him with the same variegated play, are founded upon the supreme light which is their ground.
“Supreme” means that although Śakti is also their resort in the manner already described, He is the most excellent even of that Śakti, being the abode in which even she comes to rest.
Hence He is all-pervasive, the Supreme Lord, autonomous in manifesting, uniting, and separating each mantra.
Therefore there exists nothing higher than Him.
Such is this Lord of Mantras, possessing the essence of all heroic energies previously introduced under the aspect of supreme universality.
This has already been largely settled earlier.

And furthermore:

# 10

They arise by His will, are impelled by His Śakti. || 22-7 ||
All of them become fruitful, authoritative everywhere.

# 11

Impelled perfectly by His Śakti whose very nature is the throb of autonomy, appointed to the work of grace and the rest—therefore mantras everywhere possess authority and infallibly bestow their fruits.
Thus the order is different.

Although all mantras are born from and appointed by Śiva-Śakti,
nevertheless this one possesses a great distinction from the others—thus He now establishes the proposition:

# 12

That supreme abode which is the repository of all is Śiva. || 22-8 ||
From Him alone arise mantras possessed of unfailing power.

# 13

From the first chapter onward, that supreme abode—Śaiva in nature, whose essence is consciousness-bliss, the great universal, the form of Mr̥tyuñjaya—rests in the sixfold cause from Brahmā to Śiva, and is the repository of the universe because nothing shines forth without the light of consciousness.
“From Him alone”—not from anything else, since anything else, not being self-luminous, does not exist.
The particle “ca” indicates that the universe from Māyā downward also arises solely from this foundation.
Thus the order is different.

And this is fitting, because:

# 14

Eternal, the regulator of these, without a guide, undisturbed, || 22-9 ||
beyond manifestation, without appearance, protector, saviour—Śiva!
He protects all, saves those whose minds are terrified. || 22-10 ||

# 15

Eternal existence is invaded by time and space in every direction; He, however, remains untouched by that.
He is the regulator, the ordainer of these mantras.
Swiftly, by mere will, He is their guide who manifests them outwardly and causes them to merge into their own Self.
Hence He is the chief leader, undisturbed—even by the impurities beginning with āṇava-mala from which He has emerged, while they emerge because of Him.
Thus one should supply: “beyond manifestation, without appearance.”
Manifestation is the variegated play of the universe; appearances are contracted luminosities.
Protector who guards all, saviour who liberates—thus Śiva is the supreme auspicious form of the supreme Śiva who is Mr̥tyuñjaya-Lord.
This very protection is clarified in the half-verse beginning “protection.”
Protection is safeguarding of those whose minds are terrified by saṁsāra.
This is also the etymological explanation of “Netranātha” through the syllables and letters. || 22-11 ||

As it is said:

# 16

He leads to the state of liberation, saves from great fear.
From “leading” and from “protecting” He is called Netra (Eye). || 11 ||

# 17

Moreover:

# 18

It is proclaimed as the life of all beings, formed as the Eye.

# 19

Just as The Eye illuminates objects of sight, so this Eye of consciousness, being the illuminator of everything, is called “formed as the Eye.”
Therefore it is the life of all.
It is stated in the honoured *Pratyabhijñā*:
“Knowledge and activity are considered the life of living beings.” (I.1.4)

Thus this Lord:

# 20

Is the supreme Lord over the entire host of mantras, like their sovereign. || 22-12 ||

# 21

This has already been settled earlier. || 22-13 ||

Having thus declared His superiority over other mantras by way of universal pervasion,
He now teaches it also by way of pervasion through the letters:

# 22

Praṇava is the life-breath of breathing creatures, their very life established therein.
Praṇava grasps everything with its limbs (kalās) and causes Śiva to be contemplated. || 13 ||

# 23

The great sixfold Path composed of six kinds,
resting upon the six causative stations—

# 24

It offers everything with knowledge, impelled by the huṁ-phoṇeme. || 22-14 ||
That which is its own form, to be known by itself, whose characteristic is perfect satisfaction,
the foundation of all nectar, bearing the final visarga—supreme Śiva. || 22-15 ||
Full, uninterrupted—by that full oblation which is complete.
That which is its own pronunciation, established in its own nature, self-formed, self-arisen— || 22-16 ||
Having the form of will, knowledge, and activity—that one supreme Śakti.
By her the possessor of Śakti eternally creates; He who possesses Śakti is remembered as Śiva. || 22-17 ||

# 25

Praṇava alone is the life-breath of all living creatures—the unstruck resonance which is the very form of the first assumption of all knowables and actions, the self-referential Spanda without limitation.
Without it, knowledge and activity could not occur.
When it exists, the life of those creatures—consisting in the expansion of Prāṇa, apāna, etc.—attains perfect establishment; otherwise it would be unestablished like wind in a bellows.
Though such, it voluntarily appears differentiated, together with the limbs (kalās) of a-kāra, u-kāra, etc. to be described, and by those very limbs it grasps—i.e. absorbs into itself up to samana—by the power of reflective awareness.
It causes Śiva to be contemplated by the supreme speech-activity of reflective awareness.
Moreover, in the manner described in the twenty-first chapter, by the descending order it casts into the end of the heart and causes the universe—drenched with its own nectar—to be created.
Thus the sixfold Path—beginning with the gross elements and ending with the causes from Brahmā to Śiva, resting in the six causative stations—becomes filled with the nectar-shower of Śiva.
That very Praṇava, in the form of the first assumption described earlier, assuming the form of the letters of the middle mantra, impelled by knowledge which is the predominant Śakti, casts everything into the supreme fire of the supreme abode by the combined ascending and descending movement of the middle realm.
Then, that Śiva who is called Paramaśiva, the mass of consciousness referred to by words such as “own form” previously settled—bearing the final visarga, i.e. fused with the supreme autonomy which is unmanā-Śakti—by the support of the third seed (haṁsa), drenched with the nectar of Śiva, that one supreme goddess Parābhaṭṭārikā—who is self-arisen, self-luminous, possessing its own pronunciation, abiding in its own nature by the supreme “I”-awareness, not in anything contracted such as the triad of will-knowledge-activity—becomes the very form of the Self of the Lord of consciousness.
By the etymology “that by which the universe is completely filled,” she is the complete full oblation.
By her, the universe offered into the fire of consciousness becomes uninterruptedly full, entirely consisting of the flavour of the supreme Śakti and its possessor in union.
Thus the mantrin who, through pronunciation of the mantra, has attained the supreme abode, is remembered as none other than Śiva who possesses Śakti.
The connections are slightly remote.

To clarify the statement “Praṇava grasps”:

# 26

Bound to the letters of the udgītha, consisting of tattvas, syllables, and worlds,
worlds, limbs, mantras, and the six causes. || 22-18 ||
Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Rudra, Īśvara, Sadāśiva,
and Śiva…

# 27

It is sung everywhere above as the first principle—hence udgītha is Praṇava.
In that pure letter which is its form, the sixfold Path and the six causes are bound, i.e. contained within.

And therefore:

# 28

…by the Śakti of the six, by abandonment of the six, dissolution in the seventh. || 22-19 ||

# 29

By its own unfailing Śakti whose nature is supreme throb, through abandonment of the six Paths and six causes, at the end of Praṇava-pronunciation one must rest in the seventh abode which transcends Path and cause. || 22-20 ||

This is now divided according to the sequence of the limbs of Praṇava:

# 30

A-kāra, u-kāra, ma-kāra, bindu,
ardhacandra, nirodhī, nāda, nādānta, || 20 ||
Kauṇḍalī, vyāpinī, Śakti, samanā—thus the communal ones.

# 31

“Kauṇḍalī” qualifies Śakti.
These eleven limbs of the mantra are the previously described tattvas that are communal, i.e. to be abandoned.
As stated in the honoured *Svacchanda*:
“Up to samanā, O fair-hipped one, is the endless net of bonds.” (4.432)

Above that:

# 32

The partless, the Self-tattva, Śakti, and likewise unmanā. || 22-21 ||

# 33

That which has appearance…

Emerging from the realm of kalās up to samanā, at the end of its pronunciation is the pure Self-tattva, veiled yet with the pervasion of Śiva-Śakti not yet fully blossoming.
But that very one, through identity that is about to blossom forth, has the form of unmanā-Śakti possessing omniscience, etc.
These two objects of knowledge, because they have not attained rest in Paramaśiva, have appearance—i.e. an extremely subtle contraction.
That which shines as the universe transcending and yet pervading the universe up to the ether…

# 34

…without appearance, the supreme reality, unsurpassed.

# 35

“Without appearance” as before.

Thus gradually, by the ascending path:

# 36

By abandonment of the six, the seventh is declared—the supreme dissolution and abode. || 22-22 ||

# 37

By abandonment of the previously described six (Paths and) causes, the seventh abode is supreme; everything dissolves into it—hence “dissolution”; the supreme identity is attained therein—hence “abode.” || 22-23 ||

To clarify the statement beginning “dissolution”:

# 38

There all dissolve, become identical with That, by Its grace.
Augmented by Its Śakti, the Śāktas become perfectly full. || 23 ||

# 39

Precisely because they are augmented by Its Śakti, they are Śāktas—i.e. identical with That. || 22-24 ||

Thus in that dissolution:

# 40

I shall now declare their sequence…

# 41

By which sequence those beginning with the causes…

# 42

…dissolve, O fair Goddess.

# 43

He indicates that sequence of letters from a-kāra etc., together with the manifested deities, their substrata, their presiding lords, the brahma-kalās, the elements presided over, the tattvas, and the entire manifested universe beginning with the gross:

# 44

A-kāra whose deity is Brahmā, the heart, up to the Path— || 24 ||
united with the eight kalās, one should contemplate in all creatures.

# 45

The realm whose reflective awareness is a-kāra, whose nature is the consciousness of creation, whose deity is Brahmā—from the big toes up to the heart, containing infinite worlds and the manifested universe, united with the eight brahma-kalās beginning with Sadyojāta to be described—one should contemplate in all creatures.
As Śrī Gītā states:
“Īśvara dwells in the hearts of all beings, O Arjuna, whirling all beings mounted on the machine by Māyā.” (BhG 18.61)
In this way He creates their varied consciousness, both with and without ideation.

He now names the Sadyojāta kalās:

# 46

Siddhi, r̥ddhi, dyuti, Lakṣmī, Medhā, kānti, dhr̥ti, svadhā— || 22-25 ||
these are the kalās of Sadyojāta Brahmā, abiding pervading the western direction.

# 47

“Western” means the face of glorious Sadyojāta that contains the earth, because it causes stability; hence His Śaktis have names appropriate thereto.

Now, without first enumerating the kalās, He shows the manifested universe etc. referred to by u-kāra:

# 48

Rajī, rakṣā, rati, pālyā, kāmyā, tr̥ṣṇā, mati, kriyā, || 22-26 ||
vr̥ddhi, Māyā, nāḍī, bhramanī, Mohanī—
these are the kalās of Vāmadeva, established in the Viṣṇu portion. || 22-27 ||
Up to the throat that is pervaded; the waters pervade—these abide.

# 49

Because glorious Vāmadeva causes maintenance, His Śaktis have appropriate names—thirteen in number.
In the honoured *Svacchanda* only twelve are read, with vr̥ddhi-kāyā as one and manonmanī as the thirteenth; this is the only difference seen.
“In the Viṣṇu portion” means in the portion of the Blessed Lord who presides over the prakr̥ti-tattva, whose consciousness is maintenance.
All this is contained within u-kāra by reflective awareness.

He similarly describes that referred to by ma-kāra:

# 50

Tamas, mohā, kṣudhā, nidrā, mr̥tyu, Māyā, bhayā, jarā— || 22-28 ||
these are the kalās of Aghora, established in the Rudra portion.
Up to the palate that is pervaded…

# 51

Because Aghora causes dissolution, His time and appropriate names are thus.
“In the Rudra portion” means in the portion of glorious Rudra who presides over the Māyā-tattva referred to by the ma-kalā, whose consciousness is withdrawal—the eight kalās of this Lord.

And this by the position of the tattvas:

# 52

…supreme pervasion of the Taijasa. || 22-29 ||

# 53

According to the teaching of the honoured *Svacchanda*:
“The pervasion of the kalās is the same as that of the tattvas.” (5.13)
Thus the purport of “supreme” is the essence of the pervasion of the vidyā-kalās. || 22-30 ||

Above this, in the middle of the brows:

# 54

Nivṛtti, Pratiṣṭhā, vidyā, Śānti, and likewise—
these are the kalās of Puruṣa, established in Īśvara. || 30 ||

# 55

Resting upon the veil of wind up to the shining bindu.
Because glorious Puruṣa is all-pervasive, He contains the kalās from nivṛtti to Śānti.
“In Īśvara” means in glorious Īśvara who presides over the Īśvara-tattva referred to by bindu.
“Shining” means radiant because they bring about union.

And this stage by the position of the fivefold group of kalās:

# 56

The state of Śānti is called turyā…

# 57

Now above this, beginning from the forehead:

# 58

…we shall proclaim up to nādānta. || 22-31 ||

# 59

The object of knowledge that is mantric. || 22-32 ||

And that station called nāda:

# 60

Its pervasion is Sadāśiva, called ether, having the form of void.

# 61

Meaning pervasion of the supreme ether.

# 62

Tārā, sutārā, taraṇī, tārayantī, sutāriṇī— || 32 ||
established in the station of the twelfth, up to Turya—these kalās are remembered.
These five are the kalās of Īśāna, causative in nature. || 22-33 ||

# 63

Because they are the kalās of Īśāna, they transcend Turya and have the form of turyātīta.
Hence, because they carry across saṁsāra, they have appropriate names beginning with tārā, and as five causes they are most capable of accomplishment. || 34 ||

Thus such is this:

# 64

The gross Path born of Brahmā has thus been fully described.

# 65

Born of the Brahmās—Īśāna etc.; born of the elements—ether etc.;
that whose form is pervasion of their manifested universe.

Now the subtle contained within this very one:

# 66

I shall now describe the subtle Path as it abides. || 22-34 ||

# 67

He begins to speak of it:

# 68

That ardhacandra which was described as flooding upon the head of bindu—
that nectar of Śakti is declared, united with kalās, O great Lady. || 22-35 ||

# 69

“Described” refers to:
“When the nectar of Śiva falls upon the head, it is the cause of creation…” (21.66)

# 70

there. || 22-36 ||

# 71

He shows its kalās:

# 72

Jyotsnā, jyotsnāvatī, suprabhā, vimalā, Śivā—
these are the kalās of ardhacandra, established in the station of omniscience. || 36 ||
Bound to the veil of vidyā, adorned with millions of mantras,
having the form of kriyā-Śakti, abiding pure and auspicious. || 22-37 ||

# 73

In that station which is omniscience, they abide, identical with it, graced by it.
Moreover, these are the effulgence of qualities whose nature is omniscience; because ardhacandra is predominantly light, its Śaktis have appropriate names such as jyotsnā, etc.
Bound—i.e. united—with the veil formed by the vidyā-mantras; adorned with millions of mantras which have the form of seed-letters etc., because they cause creation, having the form of kriyā-Śakti; yet because the effect is not defiled, they are pure; because inclined to grace, auspicious. || 22-38 ||

Now above this:
Rundhanī, rodhanī, raudrī, jñānabodhā, Tamopahā,
nirodhikā—these kalās obstruct all gods. || 38 ||

# 74

Eternally satisfied, greatly blessed, having the form of Vāma-Śakti.

# 75

They obstruct all gods from Brahmā downward who have not received the descent of the supreme Śakti—opposing entry into states beginning with nāda; they have appropriate names such as Rundhanī.
But for those purified by the descent of the supreme Śakti, because they awaken knowledge and destroy darkness, they are called jñānabodhā etc.
Because they obstruct the upward movement of the awakened and unawakened, they are nirodhikā kalās, pervaded by the quality of eternal satisfaction, having the form of Vāma because presided over by Vāma.

Now above that, in the nāda station which is supremely radiant with the predominance of reflective awareness, He describes Śaktis with appropriate names:

# 76

Indhikā, dīpikā, rocikā, mocikā, || 39 ||
and Ūrdhvagāminī—these kalās arise from nāda.
Endowed with autonomy, they abide in the gross and the partless. || 22-40 ||

# 77

Having the form of jñāna-Śakti, known as bestowing omniscience.

Ūrdhvagāminī, stationed up to nādānta, is indicated in the plural because adorned with the entire series of Śaktis.
Their arising is blossoming in the nāda which is the abode of nāda.
In the gross nāda possessing the eightfold sound-Śakti beginning with ghosa, they extend up to mocikā;
in the partless extremely subtle nāda which is mere subtle resonance up to nādānta,
Ūrdhvagāminī is the Śakti engaged in and granting entry into the Śākta state whose predominant icchā-Śakti is upward-moving.
Thus the division.
By saying “endowed with autonomy” He shows that they constitute the effulgence of the quality of autonomy.
By saying “having the form of jñāna-Śakti” He teaches that up to nirodhikā is the domain of kriyā-Śakti, and above nāda is the domain of icchā-Śakti.

Above that:

# 78

Subtle and extremely subtle, born of nectar and nectar— || 22-41 ||
vyāpinī also is renowned, resting upon the Śakti-tattva.
Because of unbroken connection with Śakti, presided over by cit-Śakti. || 22-42 ||
Abiding in the Śakti-tattva, these are seen as mere consciousness.

# 79

Because the domain whose predominant icchā-Śakti is subtler than jñāna-Śakti etc., therefore its Śaktis also are subtle.
Because of the excellence of that, through predominance of the touch of bliss and the power of bestowal and pervasion thereof, they have names such as “subtle” etc.
“Vyāpinī” is specially renowned, abiding above the station of Śakti up to the cavity of Brahmā.
“Śakti-tattva” means pervading the two stations called Śakti and vyāpinī, not merely the Śakti station, because vyāpinī is above the Śakti station in the supreme void and supra-void.
Because presided over by cit-Śakti, even though mere consciousness they are seen as having slight objectivity because of the non-difference from the mere measure created by mahāmāyā.
Mere consciousness means the quality of knowledge-Śakti exceeding that of nāda etc.

Now, showing the vyāpinī-Śaktis, by the word “Śakti station” He indicates all-pervasiveness:

# 80

Vyāpinī having the form of ether, called anantā and anātha— || 22-43 ||
unresting, O great Lady—these are remembered as the kalās of vyāpinī.

# 81

Because pervasion is uncontracted, because unlimited by time, because having no other lord, because resting on nothing else—thus these names belonging to the state of supreme void and supra-void.
Their form is the effulgence of the quality of beginningless awakening through the previously indicated mere-consciousness nature.

Now above the station of vyāpinī, in the samana abode:

# 82

“Form and knowledge…” (Svacchanda 4.394)

# 83

According to the indication in the honoured *Svacchanda*, the Lord shows the samana-Śaktis:

# 84

Sarvajñā, sarvagā, durgā, savanā, spr̥haṇā, dhr̥ti, || 22-44 ||
samana also is renowned—these are remembered as the kalās of Śiva.

# 85

Because of omniscience of everything up to vyāpinī, because difficult of attainment, because granting rest at dawn and evening, because desirable, because sustaining the universe, because causing the universe to become mere contemplation—these have such names.
They are the Śaktis of Śiva who presides over the Śiva-tattva, of supreme Paramaśiva.

And these:

# 86

Presiding over icchā-Śakti, bestowing accomplishment of will. || 22-45 ||
Resting upon the Śiva-tattva, radiant like a perfectly full ocean.
Stations of infinite Śakti, subtle, extremely pure. || 22-46 ||

# 87

Because this is the limit of the pervasion of icchā-Śakti, they abide presiding over icchā-Śakti.
Hence for the worshipper of this station they bestow whatever is desired by mere will.
Because of containing the universe up to vyāpinī, their lustre is like that of a perfectly full ocean.
Hence their abode is like the station of infinite Śakti, and they constitute the effulgence of the quality called infinite Śakti.
Thus the Śaktis abiding from ardhacandra-nirodhikā-nāda-nādānta-Śakti-vyāpinī-samanā
have been taught as constituting the sixfold divine qualities: omniscience, satisfaction, autonomy, lost Śakti, beginningless awakening, infinite Śakti.
“Subtle” means possessing subtlety attained through meditation;
“extremely pure” means that the Śakti-kalās are purer than the group up to nāda-nādānta, the vyāpinī-kalās purer than those, but these, for the sake of calming pervasion up to vyāpinī by becoming mere contemplation, are purer still.
In reality, however, purity is relative; for this station up to samanā, even though everything is reduced to mere contemplation, how can there be extreme purity when its essential nature is the three supreme tattvas called mantra-pure-self-unmanā-Paramaśiva? || 22-47 ||

As it is said:

# 88

Up to samanā, O fair-hipped one, is the endless net of bonds—
invaded by the stations of the six causes, gross and subtle. || 47 ||

# 89

From samanā onward, because it weaves the net, the Path up to this limit is the net of bonds—fittingly invaded by the resting-places of the six causes from Brahmā etc.
Grossness belongs to the bonds up to nādānta; subtlety to those from Śakti to samanā. || 22-48 ||

Reminding of the meaning already stated:

# 90

From Śakti to samanā is the subtle, within the range of subtle knowledge.

# 91

Attainable by excellent yogins.

Now to show the supreme tranquil pervasion free from bonds, the station of the three tattvas:

# 92

Above that is the supreme tranquil, immeasurable, free from affliction. || 48 ||
Knowing the three supreme tattvas, the guru liberates.

# 93  
“Having known” means having fully entered (samāviśya).  
As taught in the glorious Svacchanda Tantra:  

# 94  
“Having abandoned all mental activity,  
one should unite (the awareness) solely with pure illumination (bodha-mātra).  
Then the bound soul attains Śiva-hood  
and is liberated from the ocean of transmigration.” (Svacch. 4.437)

# 95  
Thus.

He now reveals the three tattvas (Śiva, Śakti, and nara) separately:

# 96  
There, that Self (asau ātmā) is pure and stainless,  
abiding upon the foundation of Its own Śakti;  
thoroughly pervaded by knowledge and activity (jñāna-kriyā-samāviṣṭaḥ),  
consisting of consciousness alone (cin-mātraḥ), free from all disturbance;  
transcending the plane of all objects,  
devoid of all senses. (22-49–50)

# 97

“There” means above samanā.
Emerging from the āṇava-mala contractions and impressions up to samanā, pure;
hence perfectly established in the foundation which is its own Śakti.
His Śakti is knowledge and activity—thus stated by “entered by knowledge and activity.”
Mere consciousness—not the mass of consciousness-bliss-autonomy which is Paramaśiva.
“Undisturbed” means no agitation after āṇava-mala, i.e. emerged from karma and māyīya malas also.
Because He has transcended the station of all objects up to samanā,
hence devoid of all inner and outer senses, transcending them, beyond their range, self-luminous by nature. || 22-51 ||

Thus this one:

# 98

Pure like crystal, the Self established in its own Self.

# 99

Pure like crystal because capable of reflecting the universe; established in its own Self because having transcended samanā.

Of this one who has transcended the bonds up to samanā:

# 100

While he abides there, that Śakti of his which causes grace— || 51 ||
as long as it does not arise, O Goddess, the Self is not Śiva.

# 101  
Even when one is established in the plane beyond the pure tri-tattva (i.e., beyond Śiva-Śakti-nara),  
so long as the supreme Śakti called Unmanā—the bestower of grace that consists of total immersion into Herself—has not yet manifested,  
even though he abides in the state that transcends the universe, that Self remains merely the individual self (ātmā), not Śiva.  
As was stated earlier:

# 102  
“Those who speak of ‘the Self’ yet do not find any other, the supreme Śiva—  
they are worshippers of the mere self; in the Śaiva path they do not reach the highest plane.” (8.30)

# 103  
Thus.

And this is perfectly logical, because even one who has ascended to that plane  

# 104  
is still slightly extended (īṣat-prasāritaḥ), pure though he be…

# 105

Slightly expanded because of the impression arising from the calming of the bonds up to samanā which produces a form of Śiva slightly different from the non-dual supreme Śiva;
pure because having transcended samanā.

He fits this with an illustration:

# 106

…like a lotus by the rays of the sun. || 22-52 ||

# 107

As long as not fully illuminated, it remains slightly expanded.

In the illustrated case, Paramaśiva is in the place of the sun.
Illumination means manifestation in supreme identity with itself.

Having stated it negatively, He also states it positively:

# 108

Just as a lotus expands instantly by union with the sun’s rays, || 22-53 ||
so the Self, grasped by Śiva-Śakti from all sides, becomes entirely Śiva.

# 109

Union means complete embrace from all sides.
Grasped means held in its own immersion.

And this one:

# 110

United with qualities such as omniscience becomes entirely Śiva— || 22-54 ||
without appearance, supremely tranquil, beyond conjecture, unsurpassed.

# 111

Possessing omniscience etc. attained through immersion in the Śāmbhava station;
therefore, as stated “becomes Śiva” through dissolution of the seed of arising which is the impressions of body etc.
When the impressions of body etc. dissolve, by the previously stated method he himself is Paramaśiva “without appearance”—the meaning is complete.

He clarifies this very point:

# 112

As long as he has not attained fullness, he is called “with appearance.” || 22-55 ||
But when the Self consisting of Śakti is fully expanded by all objects,
then grasped by her whose form is expansion, he becomes supreme. || 22-56 ||
He becomes Śiva, O Goddess, without division, in every respect.

# 113  
He who still exists together with the slightest trace of manifestation (sahābhāsa)—that is, who still abides with even a faint glimmer of light (īṣat-prakāśa) as determined by the previous view—is called “sābhāsa.”  
From that state (tataḥ, ablative with elision of lyap), taking refuge in Śiva,  
when he is fully seized by the expanding Unmanā-Śakti—which has the form of outward unfolding (prasara-rūpiṇyā) yet is indivisible from Him—and, through complete immersion into his own Self, attains identity with that Self,  
then, in every respect and without any division whatsoever,  
by means of the supreme non-dual vision that is utterly distinct from the differentiated vision of Śiva arising from the limited seer of difference,  
he alone becomes the supreme Śiva.  
As taught in the glorious Svacchanda Tantra:  

# 114  
“When one is united with that supreme Reality,  
endowed with the qualities of omniscience and so forth,  
O Goddess, one becomes Śiva alone,  
indivisible in every way.” (Svacch. 4.402)

# 115  
Thus, through the ascent and descent along the central channel (madhya-dhāma-āroha-avaroha),  
the liberation that consists of total immersion into the supreme Śiva—the very essence of the highest non-duality—  

# 116  
having thus known this,  
he perpetually makes mantras truly function as mantras. (22-57)

# 117

For one endowed with this knowledge, mantras become true mantras.

# 118

Abiding in Śakti, bestowing Śakti—all of them bestow enjoyment and liberation.

# 119

Śakti is unmanā.
Bestowing Śakti means causing the blossoming of supreme autonomy;
hence they grant enjoyment, liberation, or both according to desire.

He fits this both negatively and positively:

# 120

When the mantrin does not find the paths of creation and dissolution, || 22-58 ||
mantras in the form of arising and setting grant only slight fruit.
Meditated, contemplated, worshipped—they do not grant enjoyment or liberation. || 59 ||
Impelled by Śiva’s command they grant slight fruit.
But when the mantrin truly knows the arising, maintenance, and withdrawal || 22-60 ||
of mantras of boundless splendour in the form of arising and setting,
then they resort to servitude, obeying my command. || 22-61 ||
They become favourable to the sādhaka in the midst of existence.

# 121  
(He does) not attain entry into the central channel (madhya-dhāma-praveśa);  
the mantrin does not truly deserve even the name “mantrin.”  
The previously described descent-ascent sequence (avaroha-āroha-krama) is the emanation (sṛṣṭi) and reabsorption (saṃhāra) of the universe.  
The phrase “in the form of rising and setting” (udayāstamaya-rūpeṇa) has elision of the particle “ya” (i.e., yasya rūpam);  
by the ascending path the place of rising is the Heart;  
the place of setting is the Dvādaśānta (twelve fingers above the head);  
by the descending path the reverse.  
As taught in the glorious Svacchanda Tantra in the section on japa:  

# 122  
“Japa should be performed equal to the Prāṇa by those who desire liberation while the sun (of consciousness) is still in the day.  
That is to be known as reabsorption (saṃhāra); it bestows the fruit of the abode of Śiva.  
When the nāda that has reached the Void (vyoman) turns back again  
and comes down until it reaches the Heart—  
that night is to be known;  
this is declared to be emanation (sṛṣṭi), giving rise to the fruit of all siddhis.” (Svacch. 2.140–142)

# 123  
Thus.  

Because they (such incomplete mantrins) grant only slight results, they bestow merely slight fruits; they do not grant either enjoyment (bhoga) or liberation (mokṣa).  
Even in giving slight fruits, it is solely by Śiva’s command that they do so.  
The locus of abiding for mantras is the interval between Heart and Dvādaśānta.  
Rising and setting—their form is the fully arisen manifestation in the interval between the two extremities (Heart and Dvādaśānta)—this is reabsorption (saṃhāra).  
Servitude (kiṅkaratā) means being compelled to act according to the will of the instruments of action and knowledge.  
In other births, in the midst of Saṃsāra, on whatever plane of experience of the respective tattvas,  
they (the mantras) become directly facing the sādhaka,  
causing the manifestation of immersion (samāveśa);  
they become the enjoyers of what has already been enjoyed (bhukta-bhogasya)  
and also the bestowers of liberation.  

This (principle) He now applies to the present context:

# 124

Thus possessed by Śiva’s command, become Śiva, granting Śiva— || 22-62 ||
they become effortless, unattached, undisturbed.
By the power of this mantra of the supreme Self which is Śiva, || 22-63 ||

# 125

of the Lord of nectar, of Bhairava who conquers death.

Śiva’s command is the supreme Śakti whose nature is throb;
by this power which is the virility of the mantra,
possessed—become identical with Him;
free from attachment which is the āṇava contraction of mere measure,
and from disturbance which is the māyīya manifestation of differentiated knowables—thus emerged;
hence become Śiva.
“Thus” means knowing the truth by the stated order of arising etc.
Effortless—those from whom effort has vanished;
granting Śiva—bestowing enjoyment and liberation.
The words ending in Bhairava have already been etymologised.

He concludes the tantra’s meaning:

# 126

He who always knows the distinction between supreme and non-supreme || 22-64 ||
quickly attains the state of Lord of nectar—here no doubt.

# 127

He who, by the vision of meditation on gross, subtle, and supreme,
attains the distinction of supreme, supreme-non-supreme, and non-supreme in this Lord of Mantras—
he attains identity therewith.

And therefore:

# 128

Those who resort to this mantra become accomplished. || 22-65 ||

# 129

Because they attain living liberation in the supreme.

Moreover, one devoted to worship of this mantra:

# 130

With whatever attitude, desiring whatever fruit,
whatever deity from glorious Sadāśiva etc. he resorts to with devotion—
that very fruit he obtains. || 22-66 ||

# 131

“With whatever” means in the form of duality or non-duality etc.
“Whatever fruit” means enjoyment, liberation, etc.
“Whatever deity” means glorious Sadāśiva etc.

And there should be no doubt here due to the lowliness of a knower bound by Māyā—thus He says:

# 132

This is the truth I have declared to you, not otherwise.

# 133

“I to you” hints at the appropriateness of speaker and questioner.
As stated elsewhere: “Union with Śambhu is extremely difficult.”
Therefore in this great scripture which is the essence of all streams,

# 134

when I was urged by you, O Goddess, for the sake of universal grace || 22-67 ||
by a concealed question—all that I have revealed to you.

# 135

And because it is supremely excellent:

# 136

Thus briefly declared is the extremely rare teaching on earth. || 22-68 ||
This is not to be given to those of sinful conduct, the angry, the lustful,
those who revile the guru, who insult deity, mantra, etc., || 22-69 ||
atheists, deceivers, those excluded from scriptural dharma.

# 137

Deceivers are those attached to deceit.
Excluded from scriptural dharma means those whose actions are external enjoyment of objects, outside devotion to the Lord etc.

Thus abandoning the unfit who have not been examined and have not received the descent of Śakti:

# 138

It should be given to one’s own disciples, to one’s sons—not otherwise. || 22-70 ||
to one’s own initiated devotees who worship guru, deity, and fire.

# 139

To disciples capable of governing themselves, not to those merely taught mantras,
but to one’s own initiated devotees endowed with devotion etc., and even to one’s own sons if they are such—
this should be given for worship, truly revealed.

To one worthy of the teaching, and moreover to one of extremely unobscured discrimination or free from impossible wealth:

# 140

Without the pledge-initiation it should not be given…

“Brahmans, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas,
eunuchs, women, śūdras, and others who seek it—
at the time of initiation they are not to be examined;
for granting knowledge one should consider.
The guru is rooted in knowledge, causing the seven-session rite.”

# 141

According to the teaching of the honoured *Kāmikā*, to one whose devotion to rising Śiva is unobscured,
or even to one possessing examined wealth, having performed the pledge-initiation—
this teaching is definitely to be given, never without initiation.
It is also stated in the honoured *Mālinīvijaya*:
“There is no authority in yoga without initiation in the Śāṅkara system.”
Beginning thus: “Even authority over mantras and liberation come by Śiva-initiation.” (4.6–8)

# 142

…even to one dear. || 22-71 ||
In no way whatever is it to be given—this is the supreme command of the Goddess.

# 143

Even to a dear son, wife, etc., unfit, this supreme wealth which removes the misery of saṁsāra—supreme divine gold and raiment—is never to be given.
This alone is the supreme command of the Goddess—by the stated teaching one must always observe this pledge.

Otherwise, the seen and unseen consequences—thus He says:

# 144

By breaking the command, O Goddess, fall of the body would occur. || 22-72 ||

# 145

Therefore one must observe the command. || 22-73 ||

# 146

For one who fails to observe, He also states the unseen consequence:
If one gives through delusion, affection, or desire for wealth—

# 147

whoever at any time,

# 148

that transgressor of the command is led to a terrible hell—this is the supreme command of the Goddess. || 73 ||

# 149

“Is led” means is taken; “gamyate” here is nij-ant. || 22-74 ||

Thus considering the command of the Lord inviolable:

# 150

By preserving this, O supreme Lady, one attains accomplishment.

# 151

For one who, merely by preserving the command, enjoys the supreme wealth of knowledge—
accomplishments come into his hand; there is no wonder.

Because:

# 152

By preserving it, O Goddess, one becomes Mr̥tyuñjit, the supreme Lord. || 74 ||

# 153

Through repeated immersion in the supreme abode which is the Self of glorious Mr̥tyuñjit-Bhaṭṭāraka,
the best of yogins becomes identical therewith. Auspicious!

That whose opening and closing of eyes the hosts of yogins behold as the opening etc. of all,
that which destroys the darkness of dualistic vision and is filled with perfect non-dual bliss,
that which leads the limited soul to its own abode and protects from the great fear—
we praise that supreme Eye which is the union of the perfect energies of Śiva and Śakti. || 22-75 ||

White because it manifests the universe by its own lustre, red because of savouring That,
white-and-black because of savouring That, black because of swallowing That—
by lustre, by oneness of the wheel, neither white nor black nor both,
neither red nor not-That—such victorious supreme Eye! || 1 ||

Thus ends the twenty-second chapter in the *Netroddyota* composed by the great supreme master Ācārya glorious Kṣemarāja in the honoured *Netra Tantra*. || 2 ||

From you the darkness of the world ceases, the world always attains awakening;
vision becomes fruitful when the real and unreal are correctly established.
That you do not consider us like pigs, boars, buffaloes, jackals—
O brilliant light, that fault is in their vision, not yours. || 22 ||

# 154

Valiant in crushing the enemies of saṁsāra, refuge of the valiant,
the lineage of gurus beginning with glorious Rāma and other disciples— || 1 ||
Bhaṭṭarakta, Garbheśa, Keśavācārya etc. exerted themselves here.
Therefore something has been illuminated by me. || 2 ||
Dispelling the darkness of explanations that follow old rut-like statements,
this *Netroddyota* swollen with the nectar of supreme non-duality has arisen. || 3 ||

# 155

Having fully reflected upon the mature nectar of the words of the revered guru Abhinavagupta,
Kṣemarāja expounded this scripture with the fragrance of blossoming flowers from the glorious Uccotpala. || 4 ||

This entire becoming is swallowed, the impurities of karma and Māyā dissolved;
the state dense with bliss is attained—what more? The supreme light is obtained.
By savouring the nectar of praise of glorious Netra-Maheśvara,
we, arisen thereby, expand unbound in the pure sky of the heart. || 5 ||

That which is said to proclaim all, to establish the path,
that which by mere glance writes all, makes the threads stationed—
contemplating here that pair of Eyes which is Śāṅkara, the very Self of consciousness,
that third Eye full of supreme bliss—victory! || 6 ||

# 156

Thus completed is the text called *Śrī Amṛteśvara Netra Tāntram:*

**The Third Eye of the Lord of the Nectar of Immortality**

# 157

The work of the great supreme master glorious Kṣemarāja who savoured the dust of the lotus-feet of Abhinavagupta—auspicious! || 7 ||
