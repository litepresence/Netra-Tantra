Twentieth Chapter
Neṭrodyotaḥ: The Illumination of the Eye

# 2

Even those things sealed by the most subtle (para) yoga
are effortlessly unsealed by it.
We bow to the Eye of Maheśvara
that reveals the Eye which playfully opens and reveals the supreme non-duality.

# 3

In order to introduce the topic of the forthcoming chapter in proper sequence, Śrī Devī spoke:

# 4

Everything that the Lord has said has been asked by me and fully explained.
Now, however, a doubt has arisen in my heart and I wish to hear its resolution:

The Yoginīs, the Mothers, and the Śākinīs, who are exceedingly powerful,
how do they instantly draw forth the life-breaths from others’ bodies? 20-1

Why are they merciless and fierce? What is merciless and fierce?
What is their purpose in doing so?
O Bhagavān, You should explain all this to me completely, without omission. 20-2

# 5

By saying “I wish to hear,” the Goddess expresses her desire to understand the true meaning of her own question.
With the words “how,” “why,” and “what,” she clearly articulates her inquiry concerning the manner, the cause, and the purpose. 20-3

To resolve this, Śrī Bhagavān replied:

# 6

Listen, O Devi! I shall reveal a supreme and most marvellous secret:
how they take away the lives of limited beings (paśus) in obedience to the command of the Lord of all beings. 3

Freed from attachment and aversion, devoid of greed and delusion,
they offer animals (paśus) in sacrifice for the sake of the Yāga of the God of gods. 20-4

Not out of greed, not for the sake of injury, and certainly not out of desire to kill,
they merely preserve the injunction of the Great Bhairava. 20-5

For that very purpose were animals created by Svayambhū Himself;
animals are useful only for the sacrifice of the Lord, never otherwise. 20-6

# 7

“By the command of the Lord” means “in dependence upon Him.”
Thus the cause (“why”) is answered, and the purpose is settled by the words “for the sake of the Yāga.”
Their apparent mercilessness is refuted by the phrase “devoid of greed and delusion,” etc.
“They offer” (prokṣayanti) means “they consecrate and present as an oblation.”
“For the sake of injury” means “to cause harm.”
“For that purpose” means “for the Yāga.”
The words “by Svayambhū Himself” validate the statement “by the command of the Lord.”
The particle “ca” in “na ca” has the sense of “only.” 20-7

Moreover, they do so

# 8

for the sake of granting grace to these animals, O Fair-faced One:
they release them from sin and cut away their heaps of karma. 7

# 9

Grace means liberation. “Them” refers to the animals.

Because this is so, therefore

# 10

animals that have been thus employed always attain an upward course.

# 11

An upward course means birth in the pure worlds of Vidyā etc., or liberation itself.

And the goddesses previously mentioned

# 12

unite (the animals) with Śiva by a threefold yoga, by Śiva’s command. 20-8
By the supreme, by the subtle, and by the gross – by this triad.

They unite…

# 13

they offer up.

Since the Yoginīs thus unite the animals (with Śiva), therefore

# 14

…they do not kill them by force. 20-9

# 15

First He begins to speak of the supreme (para) yoga:

# 16

The Supreme is all-pervading, infinite, actionless, pure,
the Lord of the highest, the cause of all causes,
present within all beings, the cause of grace to all. 20-10

He dwells in the heart of all beings…

# 17

“All-pervading” means of the nature of the supreme non-duality that negates all distinction in the universe.
“Infinite” means not limited by time.
“Actionless” means devoid of sequential activity; yet He eternally possesses the power of non-sequential activity whose essence is pure throb of consciousness (sphurattā).
“Pure” means free of mala; yet by concealing His own nature He causes mala to arise while remaining untouched by it.
“All-pervading” means not contracted by space.
“Lord of the highest” means perfectly free.
Therefore He is the cause of all causes from Brahmā downwards.
“Present within all beings” means of the nature of the heart that is both light and awareness.
As it is said in the Gītā:

# 18

“The Lord dwells in the heart of all beings, O Arjuna.” (BhG 18.61)

# 19

It is He who, without difference from Himself, grants grace to all.

In that Supreme One

# 20

those stainless goddesses, freed from all weariness, are stationed,
having attained complete identity with Him; they are never separated from Him in any way. 20-11

They have fully entered Him…

# 21

Having fully entered Him, they are completely absorbed; therefore, because they have obtained supreme bliss, weariness depending on body, Prāṇa, etc., has departed from them; hence they are non-different from Him.

# 22

Merged in His power, they abide in the form of Will.
They are exalted in Knowledge and abide in the state of Activity; they shake with the Yāga and yoga (of the Lord). 20-12

# 23

“In the form of Will” means by the expansive, non-conceptual awareness.
“Exalted in Knowledge and abiding in Activity” means inflamed by Knowledge and established in the expansion of Activity.
Yāga is offering the animal to the Supreme Lord; yoga is attainment of identity with the Supreme Lord.
Those in whom the trembling produced by these two has been dissolved are motionless, consisting of perfect identity with Him.

Thus being of such nature,

# 24

assuming His state, they unite with His form those whom they choose. 20-13
Those beings become liberated, becoming Śiva Himself, impelled by Śiva’s power,
become pure, of the form of Śiva, by His grace. 20-14

# 25

Those whom they unite with His form (i.e. with Śiva) become, by the grace of these Yoginīs, impelled by Śiva’s power, liberated beings who have attained the single, pure form of Śiva. 20-15

Moreover,

# 26

just as in initiation (dīkṣā) one attains Śiva-nature

# 27

even while remaining in the body, through initiation,

# 28

so too by the yoga of the Yoginīs they attain Śiva-nature. 15

# 29

By the yoga of the Yoginīs that makes one of the nature of Caṇḍīśa (the Fierce Lord).

Thus indeed

# 30

these goddesses reveal the purity of even the extremely impure candidate previously described,
whose very form has been destroyed by mala. 20-16

# 31

Not only of the impure, but of one whose form has been ruined by the malas and thrown into vile enjoyments – of such an embodied soul they manifest purity and identity with the powers of knowledge and activity. 20-17

These goddesses

# 32

cut away the root of the three malas of those (beings).

# 33

Therefore

# 34

the body of one freed from the three malas does not grow again. 17

# 35

Thus

# 36

uniting him (with Śiva) is like lighting a lamp; there is no killing of the animal.

# 37

The Yoginīs of the supreme yoga

# 38

by their all-pervading true nature and by the splendor of their own power  
they burst open the bonds of the paśu, causing the body to perish.  
When the body perishes, it is liberation, not killing.

# 39  
By the all-pervading Śiva-nature, by the Śākta splendour that is His own Śakti, by the very act of bursting open (troṭana)—thus (the seizure is accomplished). (20)

If such is not the nature of death, then what is it?—He declares:  

# 40  
The wise know as death the separation of the puruṣa—  
whose bonds are firmly and deeply rooted—  
from the body.

# 41  
He now concludes (the entire foregoing description of the gross and intermediate methods):

# 42  
Thus the supreme Light …  
The yoga that consists of awakened repose in the Śāmbhava plane has been taught.  
… now the subtle yoga is about to be explained.

# 43  
That (subtle yoga) He now declares:

# 44  
The subtle knowledge, which is made of Śakti alone,  
is attained through the power of knowledge (jñāna-śaktyā). (20-21)

# 45

(It is attained) by the power of knowledge that has submerged the awareness of the knower who is contracted to body etc.,
following the arising of the roar-less roar of the inner spontaneous sound (nāda),
by the power of knowledge whose roar is the ever-rising supreme I-consciousness,
without the roar of any particular mantra-utterance.
The “state of sound” is the existence of that nāda-awareness; “following it” means becoming entirely absorbed in it.

This (subtle knowledge)

# 46

the perfected Khacarīs (sky-faring goddesses) constantly attend upon. 20-22

# 47

The perfected ones are Śrī Khecarī etc.; the Khacarīs are the goddesses who move in the sky of consciousness.
They attend upon it from all sides, shining as non-different from it. 20-23

Although Śākta knowledge is the foundation of everything, nevertheless

# 48

the knowledge of limited beings is impure, covered by ignorance.

# 49

Ignorance is the power of Māyā that first causes the notion “I am the non-self” in the Self and then the notion “the Self is the body” etc. in the non-self.

Therefore, by their own pure knowledge awakened through yogic practice

# 50  
Just as an awakened person playfully torments one who is asleep, wherever and however he wishes;  
just as one intoxicated by drinking liquor becomes frenzied and plays anywhere;  
just as a child, being without autonomy, wanders about here and there;  
or just as a madman is driven by one who is not mad—  
in exactly the same way the bound souls (paśavaḥ) are driven  
by the Mothers, by the Guhyakas, and by Śakti through Her own yogic power. (20-24–25)

# 51  
The word “tathā” (“in the same way”) is to be connected with the transformed sense “they are driven” (preryante).  
Guhyakas are Yakṣas and also include bhūtas, grahas, and the like.  
“By Śakti” means by Her own inherent capacity.

# 52  
And therefore, because of the yogic virility of these (Mothers, Guhyakas, and Śakti),  
the Jīva of the bound souls is swiftly dragged forth (and seized). (20-26)

# 53

He clarifies the same:

# 54

Having attained That which is supreme, unmanifest, eternal, unmoving, and steadfast,  
by the path of yoga,  
entering another’s body,  
becoming the Supreme, one should envelop the Jīva with one’s own Jīva.

# 55

“As previously described.”
“Attaining That” means entering the supreme conscious power.
“By the path of yoga” means by the practice of the spherical contemplation taught in the Tattvārthacintāmaṇi etc.,
by which the yogī, having rendered his own Prāṇa powerless by drawing it up and down,
moving through one of the paths from the feet or branches up to Brahmarandhra,
remaining in the sphere (gola) itself, enters the heart of another,
becoming supreme, having attained intense I-awareness of the other… (verses 56–57 quoted).

# 56  
“The movement (sañcāra) abides in the principle of air (Vāyu-tattva); air-principle itself is accessible to intellect (buddhi-gam); intellect resides in egoity (ahaṅkāra-gatā); and egoity is supported by the principle of mind (citta-tattva).”  

# 57  
From the standpoint of the Āmnāya revelation, when the “I”-certainty of the other has become extremely firm in those one hundred mātṛkā-letters, the Yoginī, after remaining in that hundredfold state, violently agitates him through the agitation of her own Prāṇa.  
Then, with the powers of her own senses, first invading his senses, she incorporates the body of that other—who has already accepted her Ātman-Śakti as his own—into her own body by the sequential process of her own pulsation (Spanda): activation and withdrawal.  
Thus she makes his body her own.  
Thereafter, with her own Prāṇa—which is nothing but the up-surging power of her Śakti—she envelops and completely occupies the Jīva along with his subtle body of eight constituents (puryaṣṭaka), just as the Jīva occupies his own puryaṣṭaka.  

In this manner it is accomplished.

# 58

Having overpowered him who dwells in the heart, entering from below upwards, 20-28
attaining oneness and practising equality there,
relying on the supreme cause, one should practise perfect freedom. 20-29

# 59

Relying on the supreme Śākta cause, grasping it firmly.
“There” means in the other: one should practise the thought “Whatever I do, let him also do the same,”
thus attaining oneness with him and practising freedom,
preventing him when he wishes to go, making him go when he wishes to stay –
gradually making him subject to one’s own will.
This is what the Gurus have taught: “Remaining in that state he should eat, drink, walk, stand, sleep,
until he becomes a yogī who has obtained the fruit of all actions.
Then he should bring him, release him, delude him, awaken him, fill him,
or cause him to attain a special state of distinction.” etc. 20-30

Then

# 60

by one’s all-pervading true nature and by power one should sever the power.

# 61

Having assumed the all-pervading state that is the virility produced by immersion, by one’s own power

# 62

one should sever the other’s Prāṇa-Śakti, drawing it for the purpose of cutting it,
enclosing it in a sheath and causing the cutting of the Śakti. 30

# 63

Meaning: surrounding the other’s Prāṇa-Śakti on all sides with one’s own power, one should cut it as with a knife. 20-31

# 64

Then, O Devi, the knower of yoga,  
having assumed the Śakti-form and taken the state of pure being,  
should heat it with the nature of his own being, in the form of the sun of consciousness.  
Stationed in the other, he should melt the other’s rays with his own rays, like the sun.

# 65

Assuming the Jīva of the other whose main nature is Prāṇa-Śakti,
the yogī should heat it intensely with the cause that is the throb of Śākta consciousness belonging to his own being,
in the form of the sun of consciousness.
Then, stationed in that very body of the other,
he should melt the rays of sight etc. of the other with his own blazing rays of sight etc., just as the sun melts the rays of the moon.

There also, by the force of yoga

# 66

he should unite in the heart all sounds and the rest, and the sense-organs, 20-32
the gross elements that have become essence, the qualities – everything on all sides,
the complex of the inner faculties…

# 67

All the external and internal objects related to the other that have become essence (melted) by the previously described dissolution
he should unite in himself, making them one.

Then

# 68

taking all that with his own consciousness 20-33
the yogī should enter the city (body) having overpowered it on all sides.
Having quickly taken all that which was melted, he should swiftly bring it to rest in himself. 20-34

# 69

Having taken all that previously mentioned,
according to the teaching of the Āgamas, leaving his own body through the crown of the head
and entering the body (of the other) with consciousness,
having overpowered that city,
whatever was previously melted and collected by power – all that he should quickly establish in himself. 20-35

Thus the yogī

# 70

should instantly bring the Jīva by the application of mudrā and mantra.

# 71

Here the mudrās are: first Karaṅkiṇī when leaving one’s own body,
Krodhanā when entering the other’s body,
Lelihānā when melting the rays etc.,
Khecarī when leaving that body,
Bhairavī when reaching one’s own heart.
Their binding nature has been shown by us in the Uddyota on the Vijñānabhairava.
The mantra is the five-syllabled Kṣurikā-Kālarātrī called Pañcapiṇḍakṣurikā seen in the Śrīgupta-tantra and the Śrīpūrva etc.
By the application of these the Yoginīs instantly bring the Jīva of another.

Moreover

# 72

by this method the yogī should practise the subtle yoga. 35
The knower of yoga swiftly obtains everything by the subtle yoga.

# 73

Having first practised yoga in the manner previously described,
the knower of yoga then quickly obtains by this subtle yoga
the drawing of the Jīva and all the scriptural fruits of that attainment.

He concludes:

# 74

The subtle yoga has been explained…

# 75

Now

# 76

the gross (yoga) is declared. 20-36

# 77

He teaches it:

# 78

That which abides in the body one should certainly draw out the body
by the gross method.

# 79

“That which abides in the body” means located in the gross body;
“the body” means the subtle puryaṣṭaka body –
by gross methods such as making an effigy and using various poisons etc. in a vile manner one draws it out.

Likewise

# 80

Through the rites of mantra and mudrā, through the pāṃsava method,  
solely by the power of dhyāna-yoga, and with implements such as the chummaka magnet,  
they cause the paśus’ puryaṣṭaka bodies to fall—of this there is no doubt.

# 81

Among these, killing by mantra-rite is shown in the Svacchanda-tantra… (quotes verses 82–83).

# 82  
“…The one obstructed by the King of Wrath (Krodharāja) should be drawn in the middle of a cremation-ground cloth,  
written with cremation-ground ash mixed with poison and blood.  
O Fair-Hipped One, whose name—pierced by the huṃ-phaṭ roar—  
is joined with the word ‘māraya’ (‘kill!’) and pierced by the cruel species (of beings)—  
even he who is protected by the best of protective measures dies within seven nights.” (9.64–66)  

# 83  
The procedure of the mudrā, however, is shown in the glorious Gupta Tantra beginning with the traditional transmission of mantras such as Vyomakuṇḍalinī etc., through the verses:  
“Having bound the seven-crested mudrā shaped like a ploughshare up to the tuft of hair…”  
and ending with:  
“Then the Yoginīs, making a roaring sound, devour him in the space between the crests of hair.”  

# 84  
The pāṃśava rite is also described in the same text as follows:  
“On the seventh tithi of the dark fortnight, always at dawn, O Beloved,  
the Yoginī—whether bold or timid—having gained power through nyāsa, should observe:  
whichever woman or man first emerges,  
she should make them take up the dust with left and right hands  
at the left and right feet respectively;  
for a man, with the right hand; for a woman, with the left hand in reverse direction—  
with that dust she should always cause death in the human world.”  

# 85  
The power of knowledge-yoga (jñāna-yoga-bala) is the capacity, arising from the yogic lordship that is one’s own essential form, to draw out the five nectars residing in the body of the sādhya—not, however, through the sequential path of rising (nābhyudaya-krama).  
The “chummakāni” are technical terms in the Āgamas; for example:  
- “śastraṃ” = causing division/separation,  
- “māṃsaṃ” = increasing strength,  
- “kāleyakaṃ” = flower,  
- “vasā” = cream/essence,  
- “śiraḥ” = contemplation,  
- “śastrahataḥ labdhaḥ” = obtained from one slain by a weapon.  

By the word “ādi” are indicated the characteristics and marks of the other practices taught in the Ḍākinī-Tantras—those violent severances, performed with the logic of the forcible animal (haṭha-paśu), in which the limbs of others are made into offerings by means of these very substances.  

Thus it is in this manner.

# 86

When the exceedingly powerful Yoginīs kill by the threefold yoga,
O Devi, then one should perform the highest good. 20-39

# 87

From the threefold yoga the first type grants liberation to the animal – this is stated by scripture itself;
the second and third bestow enjoyment and liberation – this is understood from the context.
In other scriptures it is also said that one eaten by Yoginīs is fit for post-mortem initiation etc. 20-40

He shows the highest good to be performed:

# 88

The knower of mantra, having known the supreme Death-conqueror (Mṛtyujit),
the immortal one with faces on all sides,
by His supreme all-pervading true nature, 40
pervading the body of the animal,
presiding over it with the power of Will,
should protect the auspicious life of the animals. 20-41
The mantrin who knows yoga should protect them,
knowing gradually by the previously described method
all those fierce female beings previously mentioned, O Glorious One. 20-42

# 89

Having known the Death-conqueror possessing the characteristics described above – i.e. the form of the essence of all mantras –
and having known the supreme yoga previously described as pervaded by the supreme power,
the mantrin who knows the virility of mantra and yoga,
pervading the body of the animal by the supreme nature previously described in meditation,
should make the bliss-throb of consciousness arise there and,
presiding over their very life with the power of Will,
should protect them by the fierce Yoginīs etc. by the previously mentioned fierce ones with mantra-sequence. 20-43

Having thus taught protection of those sealed by the supreme yoga through the sequence of supreme meditation,
He also teaches protection of those sealed by the subtle yoga through the sequence of subtle meditation:

# 90

By the path of one’s own power and by following the wheels,
by piercing the knots as previously described, by subtle meditation,
the knower of yoga should release (the victim) from all defects.
Never otherwise, at any time.
Endowed with the power of knowledge-yoga, expert in mantra and tantra… 20-44

# 91  
Having mastered the subtle yoga employed by the Yoginīs, endowed with the power of knowledge-yoga (jñāna-yoga), expert in mantra and tantra, of pure and steadfast intellect—such a knower of mantras, aware of the virility (vīrya) of mantras, the Ācārya, through his own path of Śakti, by means of the previously described cakra-support, by piercing the knots (granthi) and so forth with the nectar of subtle meditation, should liberate the sādhya (the subject of practice) from all defects. But one who is ignorant of this subtle yoga can never, under any circumstances, succeed in liberating one sealed by subtle yoga.  

# 92  
For un-sealing one sealed by gross yoga, He (the Lord) further says:  
The mantra that has conquered death, the siddha-mantra; the ascetic who has conquered the senses; absorbed in meditation and mantra; established in sattva; possessed of knowledge; powerful;  
fully contented; the supreme yogī; devoted to the performance of iṣṭāpūrta (prescribed sacrifices and public works); free from attachment and aversion; devoid of greed and delusion;  
fearless and free from doubt; wholly devoted to granting grace—O Beloved, he alone becomes the liberator from the previously described terrible defects. (20-45 to 20-47)  

# 93  
One who has conquered death through the mantra, whose mantra is perfected; an ascetic with fully controlled mind; whose senses have turned away from desire for objects; because he knows the virility of the mantra, even a perfected mantra; constantly engaged in japa and meditation; established in sattva, free from all doubt; possessed of knowledge, knower of the supreme principle; powerful, having attained the expansion of Śakti; therefore a yogī deeply absorbed in iṣṭāpūrta sacrifices, gifts, etc.; devoid of worldly defects such as attachment; fearless, bold in acts involving bali offerings and the like; free from apprehension, following the heroic conduct; the Ācārya whose sole aim is grace—through rites of Yāga, homa, bali, etc., he alone becomes the liberator from the terrible defect that has entered the mudrā, mantra, the dust of the pāṃśava rite, and so forth. (20-48)  
In this very manner the countering of mantras (mantravāda) should be performed—thus He declares:  

# 94  
But he who acts otherwise becomes the destroyer of his own self, causes the downfall of his lineage, and, being wicked, inevitably roasts in hell. (20-48)  

# 95  
He falls from his lineage, loses the stable portion of that particular deity, and perishes because of defects such as trembling, etc.  
As has been said elsewhere:  

# 96  
“I see no other flaw in the mantrin during mantra-sādhana…”  

# 97  
…and so on. (20-49)  
Even one who knows the truth should not perform mantravāda recklessly—thus He says:  

# 98  
There are bhūtas of various forms, Mothers who are malicious and violent, Yoginīs, Guhyakas, Yakṣas, Piśācas that are difficult to transgress;  
some desire offerings (bali), some desire to kill, some to enjoy; others desire intercourse and are impossible to accomplish—Skanda and the rest, as well as Brahma-rākṣasas;  
countless and terrible—never, under any circumstance, should the self-knowers, wise in their own interest, enter into conflict with them. (20-49 to 20-51)  

# 99  
The malicious and violent ones cause epilepsy and similar afflictions. Guhyakas are the principal Yakṣas. Skandas are the child-seizing grahas; by the word “ādi” are included the Vināyakas (obstructors). Self-knowledge means knowledge of the true reality. The reason for not entering into conflict is wisdom concerning one’s own welfare, because the aim is protection of one’s own body, sons, wife, etc.; for bhūtas and the rest, being opposed, always contemplate harming the body and the rest.  

# 100  
Nor should it be performed by those who seek wealth or by the greedy who seek fame.  

# 101  
The greedy are the miserly.  

# 102  
But out of compassion alone one may perform it for one’s own family, sons, and so forth. (20-52)  

# 103  
Out of compassion alone may one perform it for another. (20-53)  

# 104  
Likewise, always for kings, their sons, and their wives.  

# 105  
Because:  

# 106  
In whichever land or kingdom the knower of mantra and yoga resides, (20-53)  
there the king is the lord and ever the guru of the āśramas.  

# 107  
Because he properly protects the subjects.  

# 108  
Therefore, for his sake, those Mothers forgive the one who is presently active (in protective rites). (20-54)  
The terrible and fierce ones previously described completely subside.  

# 109  
“Presently active” means one who is performing mantravāda. “Terrible” refers to violence etc.; “fierce” refers to other bhūtas and the like.  

# 110  
And those kings, through abundant offerings of bali and great sacrifices, (20-55)  
satisfy them; therefore those (Mothers) forgive everything.  
Mantravāda should never be performed everywhere by those who meditate on Śiva. (20-56)  

# 111  
In the case already described,  

# 112  
Hear the pacification of those terrible ones who destroy the pañca-bhautika body by various means. (20-57)  
Through gross yoga applied to the gross—powders, fumigations, anointings;  
through yantras, cakras, and their applications, as well as through protection of life and the rest;  
through wearing, meditation-yoga, and always through perfected mantras;  
by those who know the procedures of mudrā and mantra, who contemplate coming and going;  
by heroic practitioners in bhūta-tantra, knowers of herbs, well-pondering;  
restrained, vigilant, devoid of all admixture;  
bathed, having performed worship, devoted to japa and meditation;  
knowers of the target, its characteristics, and the scriptures that reveal them; indifferent to gain, adorned with good qualities—  

# 113  
Mantravāda must be performed by those who desire welfare, never otherwise.  
Gross yoga consists of meditation on the form of the respective deity, etc.; powders are made from various herbs; the application of herbs is the special use of a single herb; anointing is sprinkling with water empowered by blazing mantras, etc. A yantra-cakra is a group of mantras written in a specific arrangement. By the particle “ca” is included japa with mantra-saṃpuṭīkaraṇa, etc. By these means is the protection of the previously determined life (Jīva); by the word “ādi” is included protection of the body, nourishment, etc. Wearing and other dhāraṇās, as well as yogas preceded by meditation on that—the samādhis that flood the body of the sādhya with nectar, etc.—by these. Perfected mantras are those that have been recited and accomplished or worshipped according to the prescribed method of the kalpa. By these causative factors—by knowers of mantra-procedure etc., that is, by Ācāryas as agents—mantravāda is to be performed, never otherwise. Of what kind are these knowers of mantra etc.? Those who contemplate coming and going (i.e., the fearsome characteristics of mantras); heroic, unshaking; well-pondering, whose intellect is ascended to the truth; restrained, with conquered senses; vigilant, unsmeared; devoid of all admixture, firmly established in the procedure taught by their own scripture; knowers of the target (the form seized by bhūtas etc.), its characteristics (the signs taught in the tantras), and the scriptures that are the means of knowing them; indifferent to gain, whose faults such as greed, avarice, pride, etc., are extinguished; adorned with good qualities, free from hypocrisy. The intention of “those who desire welfare” is that if it is done transgressing the proper sequence, welfare itself is obstructed. Thus, through these verses the meaning already mostly stated earlier has been explained with full elaboration.  

# 114  
If one desires the highest siddhi or eternal, unfailing liberation, (20-62)  
mantravāda should not be performed—thus declares Parameśvara.  
For the sake of grace toward mortals, kings, and householders, (63)  
it should be performed by one established in the position of grace, by one who desires their welfare.  

# 115  
“Unfailing” means certain. “For the sake of grace,” not for greed, worship, etc. “By one established in the position of grace” means by the Ācārya only with respect to the object of compassion.  

# 116  
Even then, never continuously…  

# 117  
One who always performs it comes to destruction—thus He says:  

# 118  
...if one performs it continuously, one perishes.

# 119  
Because:  

# 120  
Endowed with power, steeped in the sacrifices to Śiva, ever pure, free from fear, following the command of Bhairava— (20-65)  
the Yoginīs, bhūtas, and the rest, ever pure, devoid of attachment, aversion, etc. (20-66)  

# 121  
He gives the reason for their being endowed with power:  

# 122  
Formerly I Myself commanded them through the application of mudrā and mantra;  
they seek to slay for their own sake—therefore they are remembered as powerful. (66)  

# 123  
“Commanded” means appointed earlier to pierce the flaws of evil conduct. (20-67)  

# 124  
Here He reminds of the ancient tradition:  
Long ago, by Śiva, the Supreme Self, the God beyond gods,  
they were created in this manner and roam the ten directions. (67)  
Filled with His power, victorious, exceedingly strong,  
those greatly terrible ones formerly set out with the desire to slay the gods. (20-68)  

# 125  
“By this” means by the manner not taught in improper scriptures, whose essence is the uprooting of demons. (20-69)  
After the uprooting of the demons, when, despite being restrained by the Lord, they became invincible and intent on slaying the gods, then, setting out to enjoy the fourteen-fold creation:  

# 126  
They were seen by Svayaṃbhuva (Brahmā) formerly…  

# 127  
Because from that they were created:  

# 128  
…mantras of infallible power,  
seventy million in number, powerful, subduers, counter-agents. (69)  

# 129  
By the particle “ca” the vidyās are also subduers, independent. “Counter-agents” means of bhūtas and the like. (70)  

# 130  
And therefore:  
For pacifying those wicked, terrible ones of the world who, exceedingly powerful, seek to kill,  
and for protecting the world, (20-70)  
hundreds and thousands of mantra, herb, rite, and yoga  
were commanded by Parameśvara; for that purpose alone is their application. (20-71)  

# 131  
In all cases of mantravāda…  
in the subject already described, only occasionally out of compassion.  

# 132  
…by breaking the command one acts otherwise.  

# 133  
Thus, when employed in the subject according to the continuance of the supreme Īśvara’s command:  

# 134  
Through His influence they become powerful, the mantras of infallible power; (20-72)  
all the remaining varṇas (letters) are mere letters, filled only with His virility.  

# 135  
By the word “tat” the supreme Śiva is referred to.  

# 136  
And because, in the manner previously described, He who is the essence of the virility of all mantras, the King of Mantras,  
is declared by the Mṛtyujit (Netra) mantra as the Lord of all mantras. (20-73)  

# 137  
No mantra or vidyā of His can transgress His command.  

# 138  
All the wicked flee at the mere remembrance of this Bhagavān,  
like deer before a lion. (20-74)  

# 139  
The rest is “by the knower of truth”—thus auspiciousness. (20-75)  

# 140  
Mantras, those who make them recite, those over whom mantras have power, and all mantras whatsoever—  
those that are subject to His command: between them triumphs the Śāṅkara Eye.  

# 141  

Thus, on the Śrī Netra Tantra,  
in the *Netrodyota* composed by the venerable Kṣemarāja,  
who is supreme among the great Ācāryas devoted to Maheśvara,  
this concludes the twentieth chapter:
**Yoginis and Their Function**
