Twenty-first Chapter  
Neṭrodyotaḥ: The Illumination of the Eye

# 2  
Victorious is the supreme Eye of the Lord  
that dances the play of the bliss of its own spontaneous vibration,  
weaving all mantras into the fabric of the three realities.  

# 3  
Having stated at the end of the previous chapter that “all mantras are thus,” the Goddess, desiring to have the true nature of mantras definitively settled, spoke:  

# 4  
O God, of what essence are mantras? What is their form and of what kind?  
What is their power? How are they potent? By whom are they impelled? ॥ 20 ॥  

# 5  
Whose Self (ātmā) is it—Śambhu, Śakti, or the atomic soul (aṇu)?  
What is their essential nature: formless or embodied?  
How do they appear? Of what kind are they?  
For no formless agent is ever perceived by anyone.  
Even those with form, like a potter, are not seen as universal agents.  
What is their power—the eternal bestower of enjoyment and liberation, and remover of defects?  
How are they potent, and by what means?  
For the formless, like space, possesses no potency; hence, how can agency arise from that which is impotent?  
If they possess form, being limited and impure, how can they possess autonomy or power?  
A bodiless being cannot act as an agent in bestowing grace or similar functions,  
nor is it logically tenable that it be merely an instrument of the supreme Lord.  
Thus, with the underlying question: “How can even the supreme Lord, if formless, possess potency and the capacity to impel?”  
the Goddess asks: “By whom are they impelled?”—meaning, by what kind of agent? ॥ 21-1 ॥

# 6  
If, O Lord, the mantras are of the nature of Śiva — all-pervading and formless —  
how can they possess agency, being devoid of action and instruments? ॥ 1 ॥  
Because they are without body, how can their agency be logically established?  
Without a form, who performs any action? Tell me, O Lord. ॥ 21-2 ॥  

# 7  
If mantras are of the nature of Śiva, then, like Śiva, they are all-pervading and devoid of spontaneous vibration, action, and instruments — how can they have agency?  
Even from the standpoint of being formless like Śiva, such agency is not reasonable,  
for no one without a body has ever been seen to perform action.  
Thus the claim that Śiva impels mantras is also refuted by the same reasoning.  
This is also the view of those who know the other scriptures (śrutyanta):  
they hold that only that which possesses attributes can be an agent,  
and therefore, thinking the attributeless Brahman taught for worship is non-agent,  
they desire an impersonal, non-dual Brahman similar to the Sāṅkhya puruṣa that is forever still and actionless. ॥ 21-3 ॥  

Because:  

# 8  
No activity of a bodiless being,  

# 9  
not even of the supreme Lord, has ever been seen.  

And thus:  

# 10  
Since bondage arises only for the embodied…  

# 11  
Therefore  

# 12  
…how can one who is bound possess agency? ॥ 3 ॥  

# 13  
Moreover, precisely because they would be embodied, the entire class of Śiva-mantras etc. would be impure;  
being impure, they would lack autonomy and be conceived as deprived of power.  
It has indeed been said in the revered Kirana:  
“The paśu is eternal, formless, ignorant, and devoid of activity.” ॥ 21-4 ॥  

Hence:  

# 14  
Agency in one devoid of power is contradictory in regard to all things.  

# 15  
Let it be granted in a limited portion, as in the case of the potter’s animal — what is achieved by that?  
Thus the fivefold question — of what essence, of what nature, of what kind, how potent, and by whom impelled — has been clearly posed under the hypothesis that they are Śāmbhava.  

Now the question “What is their power?” is clarified:  

# 16  
In this way, how can mantras that are of the nature of Śiva actually be established? ॥ 4 ॥  

# 17  
From the viewpoint just stated, how can mantras whose nature is the all-pervading, formless Śiva — who is eternally liberated and pure consciousness alone — actually be established,  
and how can they bestow attainments? That is the meaning. ॥ 21-5 ॥  

Having thus examined the Śāmbhava hypothesis, the Lord now examines the Śākta hypothesis:  

# 18  
Or if they consist of the form of Will (icchā-Śakti)…  

# 19  
Then, if they are of the nature of Śakti, that Śakti  

# 20  
…of whom is it the power, and of what kind is it?  

# 21  
To what does it belong, and what is its essential nature?  
The Lord examines that very nature:  

# 22  
Is Śakti the cause, O God, and what is the nature of its effect? ॥ 5 ॥  

# 23  
Is the power one that cooperates with the essential nature, or is it transcendent and known only through its effects?  
What kind of effect does it have?  
It cannot be said that Śakti, whose essence is the capacity to act (śakana), is an independent reality having the nature of a separate substance cooperating with the essential nature,  
for mere naming does not remove the difficulty. Therefore He says:  

# 24  
As long as no possessor of power whatsoever…  

# 25  
…exists,  

# 26  
…to whom is power ascribed?  

# 27  
It is asserted.  

Because that [power]:  

# 28  
Cannot be established as autonomous without some already established entity. ॥ 21-6 ॥  
Whatever is to be proved by means of something unestablished is itself declared unestablished.  
Here no power that is empty of real substance is nowhere found. ॥ 21-7 ॥  
Mantras that are solely of the nature of power are nothing but an inversion [of the truth].  

# 29  
The notion that mantras consist solely of power—that is, that they are nothing but the power of Śambhu without any substrate—is an erroneous inversion.  
For no autonomous power, such as the capacity to burn, is ever established without a substrate like fire.  
Nor is it reasonable that the very power whose essence is the capacity to act could establish some possessor of power,  
because without the substrate being established, the power is not established,  
and without the power being established, the substrate is not established—this is mutual dependence (anyonyāśraya).  
As it is said: “That which is proved by means of something unestablished is itself unestablished.”  
Nor is there any transcendent power that exists without a possessor.  
Therefore, mantras are not Śākta either.

# 30  
Or if the mantras are atomic, possessing forms with bodies, ॥ 21-8 ॥  

# 31  
Then they  

# 32  
Are known to be of the nature of limited souls — impure and not powerful.  

# 33  
And thus:  

# 34  
An impure being, like an impure being, cleanses whose impurity? ॥ 21-9 ॥  

# 35  
Only the pure are able to remove impurity from the impure, not the impure themselves.  
Mantras, being atomic, are impure like limited souls. ॥ 21-10 ॥  

And thus:  

# 36  
Atomic mantras taken alone are not established, O supreme Lord.  

# 37  
Those that are atomic are neither autonomous nor pure.  
How then could they make others autonomous or accomplish what is otherwise impossible? This is the remaining intent.  

Then they must be something else entirely. He says:  

# 38  
Existence apart from the triad of principles is contradictory in the continuum of reality. ॥ 10 ॥  

# 39  
It is stated in the Āgamas that nothing exists apart from the three principles,  
nor is anything possible apart from the nature of supreme knower and known. ॥ 21-11 ॥  

Therefore:  

# 40  
Here only logical reasoning is to be stated for the sake of the welfare of living beings.  

# 41  
How is this to be reconciled?  
Because only reasoning in the form of proper investigation is convincing to every heart.  
As it is said in the Saurabheya:  

# 42  
“That reasoning which has the form of the activity of consciousness is the means everywhere,  
whether in enjoyment or in liberation; therefore one should honour it.”  

# 43  
Thus.  

It should not be objected: “If mantras cannot be established by reasoned thought, let them not be established.”  
Because:  

# 44  
Mantras are seen to be powerful, invincible even by gods and demons unassailable, ॥ 11 ॥  
Bestowing all grace, all-bestowing, all-pervading, auspicious.  

# 45  
Mantras such as the Lords of the four kalās (Catuṣkalanātha etc.) are directly experienced as granting the removal of suffering, attainments, and liberation.  

Thus:  

# 46  
In brief, O Mahādeva, tell me this doubt of mine. ॥ 21-12 ॥  
There is no other whatsoever more excellent than You, O Lord of the universe.  
Speak everything, O Maheśāna, if You are pleased with me, O Lord. ॥ 21-13 ॥  

# 47  
O Mahādeva, my own Self, in brief, resolve this doubt for me — make the object of doubt certain.  
Since there is no other decider more excellent than You,  
therefore speak everything exactly as I have asked. ॥ 21-14 ॥  

Having heard thus, the holy Lord said:  

# 48  
Ah! This is a most profound question; no one has ever asked Me thus.  
Yet I Myself have always impelled everything in all the scriptures. ॥ 14 ॥  

# 49  
But the deluded, ever veiled by Māyā, do not discover it.  
The question You have asked is extremely profound; I have never been asked it by anyone.  
Whatever I have to say on this subject has been stated in all the scriptures.  
People, veiled by Māyā at all times, do not attain it despite its having been stated, because they turn away from it.  
You, however, though knowing the true essence of the scriptures, ask only out of compassion for deluded beings, wishing to make it clear.  
Alternative reading: “I have never been asked by anyone” means that although I have been questioned by Kumāra, Brahmā, Viṣṇu and others on different topics,  
and although I have awakened them on those topics in various scriptures,  
they still do not discover it.  
You, however, being a knower of the truth, have asked this most profound question.  

Now He settles what was asked:  

# 50  
A mantra cannot properly be spoken of as a real entity apart from the triad of principles. ॥ 21-15 ॥  

# 51  
Mantras possess the dharma of protecting through contemplation (manana-trāṇa);  
they abide in the atomic realm of the power of knowledge and action,  
yet because the power is inseparable from its possessor, they are also Śāmbhava. This is the meaning. ॥ 21-16 ॥  

Here He states the maxim of the stick and the cake (daṇḍāpūpikā-nyāya):  

# 52  
Let that be for the moment…  

# 53  
the class of mantras that is the topic under discussion.  

# 54  
The entire universe does not become established without the principles.  
The principle is the supreme Śiva whose essence is pure, pure, autonomous conscious light.  
And that alone  

# 55  
is the establishment of the universe, because a non-light cannot be established by a light-possessing entity.  

Thus, precisely because it is of the nature of supreme conscious light:  

# 56  
Everything whatsoever that is seen here is constructed of the triad of principles. ॥ 16 ॥  

# 57  
The supreme light, through its absolute purity and autonomy,  
on the ground of the triad of principles — will, knowledge, and action —  
manifests the universe whose nature is to be desired, known, and acted upon,  
as though non-different from itself, yet as though different,  
just as the knower (Jīva) manifests the sequence of signifier and signified in the levels beginning with paśyantī. ॥ 21-17 ॥  

In the manner stated:  

# 58  
O Goddess, no entity whatsoever exists apart from the triad of principles.  
Therefore everything is the triad of principles — both the supreme and the non-supreme. ॥ 17 ॥  
The supreme is the pure path; the non-supreme is the impure. ॥ 21-18 ॥  

And thus:  

# 59  
Mantras are to be known as Śiva in nature, as power in nature, and as atomic in nature;  
they exist through the division of the triad of principles, possessing boundless radiance. ॥ 18 ॥  

# 60  
They are forms beginning with Śiva, invested with the powers beginning with the supreme will of the Lord;  
hence they possess boundless radiance — power that is unobstructed in bestowing grace everywhere. ॥ 21-19 ॥  

To explain at length that the universe has the nature of the triad of principles, He says:  

# 61  
The supreme is all-formed, pure, beginningless, the constant cause,  
immeasurable, indescribable, incomparable, free from affliction, ॥ 19 ॥  
free from manifestation, supremely peaceful, devoid of all parts,  
all-pervading, auspicious in every direction, endowed with omniscience and other qualities, ॥ 21-20 ॥  
completely filled with dense consciousness, delighted by its own bliss,  
devoid of (limited) bliss, free from alternatives, free from ritual, free from syllables, ॥ 21-21 ॥  
non-dual, devoid of imagination, dense consciousness, destroyer of the impurity of consciousness,  
pervading consciousness and non-consciousness, to be known as eternally arisen, unsurpassed, ॥ 21-22 ॥  
unchanging, supreme, eternal, immaculate, undisturbed,  
devoid of all comparison, devoid of all states, ॥ 21-23 ॥  
transcending all forms and parts, immovable, everlasting, all-pervading,  
all-going, abiding in all states, present in all beings, ॥ 21-24 ॥  
abiding in the heart of all beings, impeller of all things.  
Nothing is seen devoid of it, O Goddess worshipped by the gods. ॥ 21-25 ॥  
Therefore the universe is all-pervading; He alone is the supreme Lord.  
Omniscient, eternally satisfied, His consciousness is beginningless. ॥ 21-26 ॥  
Autonomous, possessing unfailing power, of infinite power is the Great Lord.  
The will of that Great Lord is in no way to be imagined otherwise. ॥ 21-27 ॥  
Because of its immeasurability and beginninglessness, how can it be grasped by anything?  
It is understood in reality only through inference from its effects. ॥ 21-28 ॥  
Its effect is the supreme power, like the rays of the sun,  
to be known like the heat of fire — inseparably present. ॥ 21-29 ॥  
Bestowing bliss on all, auspicious, following the will of Śiva,  
possessing His attributes, peaceful, eternally bestowing grace. ॥ 21-30 ॥  

# 62  
All this is the transformation (vivarta) of that power of His; it does not arise from anything else.  
The supreme abode is to be known as qualified by attributes such as being the Self of all.  
Its power called will is exactly of that nature — to be inferred from its effects, from the arising of the universe and so forth.  
The effect is also that very supreme, non-dual power of the Lord — non-different from Him.  
Thus all this is the vivarta of the power of the supreme Lord — its appearing in manifold forms. That is the purport here.  

# 63  
The supreme is that which is most excellent, the primal reality, the principle that conquers death, dense consciousness;  
“all-formed” means that all is its Self, its essence.  
“Pure” means not covered by anything.  
Because it brings forth on its own canvas the universe from Śiva down to earth, though non-different from itself, yet as though different, it is the constant, beginningless cause.  
For no cause other than this supreme light, this autonomous conscious light, is established.  
As said in the Pratyabhijñā:  
“That which is non-existent cannot properly be connected with non-existence;  
non-existence does not have the nature of existence.  
Even existence is not spoken of as gaining existence again.”  

# 64  
“In the world, causality belongs to things that revolve within each other.  
Both [cause and effect] being perceptible to the senses is due to the power of something else.” (ĪPK 2.4.3-4)  

# 65  
Thus.  
Because it is the cause of the universe, it is immeasurable.  
Hence it cannot be pointed out or described as “it is such and such.”  
Thus it is incomparable — there is no simile for it because nothing else exists beyond it.  
It has gone beyond limited manifestation and slight shining like limited consciousness;  
that is, it does not shine even slightly like contracted consciousness.  
Because the universe abides in identity with it and difference is quelled, it is supremely peaceful.  
Unlike the stage of Sadāśiva and Īśvara, the universe is not even imagined there as parts;  
therefore it is said to be devoid of all parts.  
All-pervading, auspicious in every direction.  

# 66  
“With what name or form is the all-pervading one that brings about auspiciousness?”  

# 67  
This is clarified by “pervading consciousness and non-consciousness.”  
“Endowed with omniscience etc.” is explained by “omniscient, eternally satisfied” and “dense consciousness.”  
“Delighted by its own bliss” means: just as light is said to be self-luminous,  
so bliss that is the wonder (autonomous) wonder belonging to itself alone, not dependent on another — that is vimarśa — delights it, makes it abound;  
it is not an object of enjoyment like sensory pleasure.  
It is free from limited joys and contracted wonders;  
it is free from alternatives, rituals, and syllables (akṣara here meaning the Jīva and the signifying mantra-body).  
Non-dual, devoid of imagination, unsurpassed, dense consciousness, non-dual.  
Hence it destroys the contraction that is the concealment of its own nature — the impurity born of Māyā-Śakti in limited souls.  
Eternally arisen, ever throbbing.  
Free from the changes of birth, continuance, and transformation that belong to the entire universe.  
Supreme, filling the universe.  
Eternal, untouched by time; immaculate, untouched by the impurity of aṇu;  
undisturbed, free from adventitious māyīya and kārmika impurities.  
Just as because of non-duality there is no similarity with anything, so there is no comparison at all.  
Devoid of all states that are qualities of intellect.  
It transcends the forms and parts of all principles beginning with earth — the aspects that are being “part-ized.”  
Immovable, everlasting as before.  
All-pervading, the Lord; “all-going” means it goes to all, causes all to go, and withdraws all (gam with intensified verbal root).  
Present in all states, both inert and non-inert, because without it they could not endure.  
This is clarified by “abiding in the heart etc.”  
Abiding in the heart of all beings — in the position of the knower — as the inner animator,  
it is the impeller of all things, bestowing the agency of the knower upon each respective object.  
Hence nothing is seen devoid of it, because the shining thing is one with its light.  
Since this is so, therefore the universe is all-pervading;  
the universe is nothing but that one supreme Lord, non-dual — thus the supreme non-duality is established.  
“Omniscient” etc.” has already been explained.  

Thus the will-power of the Lord of this description is exactly of this description.  
“From its effects” means it is inferred from effects such as the creation and dissolution of the universe — the very capacity of the conscious Lord.  
As said in the Pratyabhijñā:  

# 68  
“Power is the difference superimposed because of difference of fruit upon the entity that is the substrate.”  

# 69  
Thus.  
That very effect of the possessor of power is the supreme, non-dual power — consisting of manifestation, i.e., of the nature of knowledge-power.  
Hence it is non-different, like the sun’s rays.  
Shining in exactly this manner, it bestows bliss on all and causes entrance into Śiva.  
Hence it is auspicious, called “welfare-bringing” because it abides in conformity with the stated will of Śiva.  
Hence peaceful, unchanging because of having that nature,  
and eternally bestowing grace precisely because of being of that nature.  
The entire universe is created by the power of action;  
it is the vivarta of that very power whose nature is the manifestation of the universe — its appearing in manifold forms.  
Hence it does not arise from anything else, because nothing else exists apart from that power.  
As said in the Śiva-sūtras:  

# 70  
“Whose play of powers is the universe.” (ŚSū 3.30)  

# 71  
And in the Sarvamaṅgalā:  

# 72  
“His powers are the entire universe; the possessor of power is Maheśvara.”  

# 73  
Thus.  

Thus:  

# 74  
The supreme power is possessed of bliss; supreme Śiva is devoid of (limited) bliss. ॥ 21-31 ॥  

# 75  
She abides with intense bliss, with overflowing joy — that is “possessed of bliss.”  
He in whom bliss consists of complete repose in supreme identity — He is “devoid of (limited) bliss.” ॥ 21-32 ॥  

Because of the overflowing character of bliss, the power, brilliantly shining forth,  
manifests the six qualities beginning with omniscience. He says:  

# 76  
The qualities beginning with omniscience that belong to Śiva, the supreme Self,  
are Śākta — they are not seen to belong to anything else, because otherwise it would be illogical. ॥ 32 ॥  

# 77  
When the supreme power attains the state of knowledge with will at its head,  
the qualities beginning with omniscience become manifest — they belong to the Śākta level. This is the meaning.  

Thus:  

# 78  
Śiva is one, and His power likewise is one alone, eternal,  
abiding in non-dual non-duality, she alone is the totality. ॥ 21-33 ॥  

# 79  
She abides in non-duality that negates duality;  
she is the totality — the perfect identity of the entire universe.  

Though abiding with the variety of qualities beginning with omniscience, how is she non-different? He says:  

# 80  
This will of Śiva is non-different, facing all directions.  
Because of the slight expansion (ucchūnatā), the qualities beginning with omniscience arise from that. ॥ 21-34 ॥  

# 81  
The supreme power, attaining slight expansion, becomes knowledge-power and action-power,  
and thereby abides as omniscience and the other qualities. This is the meaning.  

Hence He says:  

# 82  
When that same single power fully awakens,  
— that awakening is beginningless, infinite — she is remembered as the supreme knowledge, ॥ 21-35 ॥  
known as knowledge-power, the seat of qualities beginning with omniscience.  
When she, autonomous and of unfailing power, becomes the form of instruments,  

# 83  
manifesting sound as sphaṭa etc. in eightfold division of varṇa-form,  
she is designated Mātr̥kā, the power of action, O Māheśvarī. ॥ 21-36-37 ॥  
That supreme power called action is the form of all speech.  

The supreme power already mentioned earlier, when she awakens, is one alone;  
yet because of the limiting conditions of various functions, she is spoken of as having various forms.  
“Because awakening” means: since awakening is unlimited by space, time, etc., without beginning or end,  
that supreme knowledge is that very supreme power — she is renowned as knowledge-power.  
Hence she is remembered as the seat of the stated qualities — omniscience, eternal satisfaction, beginningless awakening, infinite power — because they are inseparable from knowledge-power.  
When that same supreme power, having assumed the role of knowledge-power, at the time of universal creation becomes autonomous (and therefore) of unfailing power,  
then she becomes the form of instruments, the form of creation — she is called action-power.  
Anticipating the doubt how knowledge-power, which is without sequence, can have the form of sequential action, He says “in eightfold division of varṇa-form…”  
Awakening is in essence the throbbing of the power of vimarśa whose essence is the autonomy of “I”;  
otherwise, if it were mere retention of forms, it would be equal to inert crystal etc.,  
because the capacity to awaken as “I am the doer” would be impossible.  
Even the arising of forms would be impossible without that cause which is distinct from mere awakening, because it would not shine.  
Therefore awakening is nothing but the supreme Word that is throbbing “I”-vimarśa, the reality of agency.  
As said in the Pratyabhijñā:  

# 84  
“They know vimarśa as the essential nature of manifestation.” (ĪPK 1.5.11)  

# 85  
Thus,  

# 86  
“Consciousness is supreme speech whose essence is inner recognition.” (ĪPK 1.5.13)  

# 87  
And so forth.  
In the Vākyapadīya also:  

# 88  
“If the eternal capacity of speech-form were to depart from awakening,  
light would not shine; for she is the inner recogniser.” (VP 1.125)  

# 89  
Thus.  

Thus the supreme Word-power that is awakening-autonomy itself, ranging from paśyantī down to gross sound, having the nature of sound,  

# 90  
“Ghosa, rāva, svana, śabda, sphaṭa-known, dhvani,  
jhāṅkāra and dhvaṅkṛti — these eight sounds are declared.”  

# 91  
According to the Svacchanda teaching (11.6.7),  

# 92  
“First like blazing fire, then like split bronze, then like a flute,  
like a humming bee, like a fifth-string, like all strings together,  
like a bell, like a cloud, like a struck lute-string —  
thus the nāda is audible in ten ways, becoming successively subtler.”  

# 93  
According to the teaching of my Guru, the eightfold sound pervades the fifty varṇas from a to kṣa  
in the form of Bhaṭṭāraka;  
she is the mother of the entire pure and impure universe consisting of all mantras etc.,  
the unknown Mother Mātr̥kā, the supreme Goddess who is action-power.  
Though herself without sequence, she is called sequential action because she manifests as all speech — signifier and signified.  
As said in the Pratyabhijñā:  

# 94  
“Sequentiality in ordinary action arises from the power of time;  
it does not apply to the eternal action of the Lord, just as it does not to the Lord Himself.” (ĪPK 2.1.2)  

# 95  
Thus.  

Thus, manifesting sequence through her own autonomy:  

# 96  
In this way she is called “action,” born of one’s own non-dual essence. ॥ 21-38 ॥  
Arisen from her own essence, whose object is her own essence, self-arisen, auspicious.  

# 97  
Though one and non-dual in essence, when she assumes sequence in the manner described,  
the supreme Goddess-power is called “action.”  
She is not only born of no other essence — hence “born of non-dual essence” —  
but her very arising is the overflowing of universal form;  
thus her autonomy is shown both negatively and positively.  
Though herself overflowing as the universe, she remains in her own form — “self-arisen.”  
She is not covered by the universe but is self-luminous;  
hence “self-arisen,” self-luminous.  
Hence objects that are non-different from herself are the universe — the meanings.  
Hence she is “self-constituted” through the special manifestation of the universe.  
Hence she is auspicious, having the form of Śiva who is pure, autonomous conscious light.  
As said in the Pratyabhijñā:  

# 98  
“She whose genius is to assume the sequence of various objects  
— the subject who is non-sequential infinite consciousness is the Great Lord.” (ĪPK 1.7.1)  

# 99  
Thus.  

He clarifies this:  

# 100  
She is not different; she is called power — agency. ॥ 21-39 ॥  

# 101  
The particle “ca” means “indeed.”  
For the autonomous agent, its very essence is agency — the negation of any other attribute.  
That very essence is called power — capacity to act — spoken of as non-different from the capable one.  
Therefore she is not different.  
As said in the revered Vijñānabhairava:  

# 102  
“Because non-difference between power and possessor of power is firmly established,  
therefore, because of possessing His attributes, the supreme power belongs to the supreme Self.” (VBh 18)  

# 103  
Thus. ॥ 21-40 ॥  

Objection: If Śiva, the possessor of power, shines forth as the universe,  
then He would undergo modification and, like the Māyā-principle, become the material cause;  
there would have to be another agent as efficient cause presiding over it.  
As it is taught in the revered Mālinīvijaya:  

# 104  
“In order to accomplish the instruments of experience for the experiencer who desires experience,  
the King of Mantras produced the universe by agitating (or entering) Māyā with His powers.” (MVṬ 1.25)  

# 105  
Thus there would have to be some agitator similar to Ananta Bhaṭṭāraka.  
Anticipating this objection, the Lord says:

# 106  
Since Śiva is perfect, autonomous, and all-pervading,  
who could be the agent of action? Who could be the disturber?  
From this arises the non-duality in Śiva. || 40 ||  

# 107  
“His powers are all this universe; yet the great Lord Maheśvara is the possessor of power.”  
In this condition, because He is the Self of the universe,  
because the Blessed One—who has conquered death, whose nature is consciousness and bliss, who is perfect—has no need of anything else due to His absolute plenitude,  
because He is autonomous and all-pervading,  
who is the agent? Who is the disturber?  
There is none whatsoever,  
for nothing exists apart from the autonomous Conscious Bhairava.  
Precisely because this is so, therefore in Śiva—in the Blessed Lord Bhairava—there is non-duality, the form of supreme non-duality;  
duality has no existence at all.  
Thus it is said by the venerable Kātya in the venerable Pūrva-vārtika:  
“Because the universe is pervaded by Him, difference is contradicted; therefore the non-difference of the universe with Him.”  
And because the Lord’s nature is consciousness, and because there is no limitation by the objects of consciousness, time, place, etc., His pervasion is established to that extent.  
By this very reasoning, even the atom, the supremely great space, and all else, being interwoven both within and without, how could there be difference?  
Because difference is contradicted, therefore by that very pervader there is non-difference between the conscious and unconscious universe. || 41 ||  
Thus, because He is the Self of the universe—  

# 108  
That all-powerfulness of His is conventionally called His Śakti.  
By that Śakti alone He performs creation, maintenance, and dissolution. || 21-41 ||  
The Blessed Lord performs everything—concealment and grace.  

# 109  
That all-powerfulness of the Blessed Lord is itself His Śakti, His autonomy.  
From His own autonomy alone the Lord is the power of the universe.  
As declared in the Śiva-sūtras—  

# 110  
“His accumulation of Śaktis is the universe.” (ŚS 3.30)  

# 111  
“It is conventionally spoken of” means it is spoken of as different from Śiva for transactional purposes, but in reality no difference whatsoever between the universe and the Śakti of Śiva, or between Śiva Himself, is possible.  
Thus it is said in the Pratyabhijñā:  

# 112  
“Śakti, which is the very nature of entities, is a difference superimposed because of difference in effects.”  

# 113  
And by that Śakti which is not different from Himself the Blessed Lord performs everything.  
This very fact—that He performs the five acts beginning with creation—has been clarified by the special statement.  
He now shows this very thing in detail:  

# 114  
By the power of action He creates; by the power of knowledge He maintains the universe. || 21-42 ||  
By the power of Rudra He performs dissolution; by Vāmā He performs concealment;  
by Jyeṣṭhā He performs grace—there is no doubt about this. || 21-43 ||  

# 115  
The possessor of power has only one Śakti, but it is called Jyeṣṭhā etc. owing to difference in function. Thus he says—  

# 116  
Because the fivefold function of Śambhu in regard to the universe is seen,  
that which is performed, that which is to be conceived, is the activity of the All-Knower. || 21-44 ||  

# 117  
Because the function in the universe—the activity—is seen performed in five ways as creation etc.,  
therefore that activity of Śambhu, that vibration, which is to be conceived, is spoken of as differentiated into the powers Jyeṣṭhā etc. || 21-45 ||  
Thus—  

# 118  
Therefore this Śakti of Śiva alone is inferred.  

# 119  
From everything that appears, the Śakti whose nature is appearance is inferred to belong to the Lord Śiva who is the appearer, whose nature is consciousness—not to any other whatsoever.  
Since the supreme sovereign Śakti alone is the cause of every effect, therefore—  

# 120  
The finite souls are infinite in number and are obstructed solely by mala. || 45 ||  

# 121  
They are graced by the supreme Śakti through the will of the Supreme Lord.  
Previously determined as contracted by the mala whose nature is the contraction of the Māyā-Śakti,  
the finite souls are obstructed by that mala of the soul; they hold the notion “I am complete,” “I am separate.”  
Hence they are infinite in number.  
And those very souls, when graced by the supreme will of the Supreme Lord, attain identity with the Supreme Lord.  
Thus—  

# 122  
Śiva, Śakti, and the Self—these three principles are the supreme, unsurpassed reality. || 21-46 ||  

# 123  
First, the supreme excellence of Śiva and Śakti has been stated in the manner described;  
as for the Self, even though it appears contracted, it is supreme because it is the knower, whose very nature is the light of consciousness. || 21-47 ||  
Thus the supreme Lord Śiva-Bhaṭṭāraka, having vibrated in the form of the triad of principles named Śiva, Śakti, and Self, again out of autonomy—  

# 124  
The God who has three forms—Rudra, Viṣṇu, and Pitāmaha—  
performs the sixfold creation that is divided into four kinds. || 47 ||  

# 125  
“Having three forms” means He alone is the three-formed One.  
“Creation” includes by implication maintenance and dissolution. || 48 ||  
He now shows the sixfold and fourfold nature:  

# 126  
Pretas, beings in hell, animals, divine beings, sages, and humans—  
viviparous, oviparous, O Goddess, as well as moisture-born and sprout-born. || 21-48 ||  
By His power the Blessed Lord, being all-pervading, performs everything.  

# 127  
The creation of pretas and hell-beings is tāmasic;  
that of animals, birds, reptiles, etc., is slightly less tāmasic.  
Divine creation is sāttvic.  
That of sages is composed of rajas and sattva.  
Human creation is composed of rajas and tamas.  
Thus it is said in the venerable Svacchanda-tantra:  
“First He performs the tāmasic creation that is full of tamas—  
hells of various forms, animals, immovable beings, etc.  
From a mixture of tamas and rajas He then creates humans.  
Possessed of rajas and sattva He creates the excellent sages and lords.  
Free from sleep, fully awakened, possessed of sattva, the Lord of the universe  
creates the gods and lords of worlds in the previous orderly manner.”  

# 128  
Thus humans etc. are viviparous; birds etc. oviparous;  
mosquitoes etc. moisture-born; plants sprout-born;  
sages and gods are mostly mind-born.  
From His power, which is His sovereignty in the form of autonomy—  

# 129  
He now establishes this very point:  

# 130  
The Lord is the efficient cause, just as the sun is the efficient cause of the action of a gem. || 21-49 ||  
But that Śakti is the material cause, agitated through intimate union.  

# 131  
The efficient cause assists merely by proximity, not by entering into activity;  
the universe is manifested by its own Śakti—this is why the Lord is the cause, the agent, the illuminator and the rest, the Supreme Lord.  
And His own supreme Śakti, which is inseparable from Him, is the material cause.  
Agitated through intimate union—through the state of oneness with Śiva—  
it becomes slightly swollen, suitable for producing the universe, and rests upon the level of Samanā.  
Just as the sun is the efficient cause, just as the action of the gem is the material cause in the production of fire—this is the illustration.  
This very oneness of Śiva and Śakti, though not different from Himself, is yet presented as different—  

# 132  
“His accumulation of Śaktis is the universe” (ŚS 3.30)  

# 133  
According to the teaching of the Śiva-sūtras, He unfolds the universe;  
He does not depend upon anything external, nor is He impelled by any purpose.  
The illustration with the sun-gem etc. is only partial, not total,  
for otherwise Śiva and Śakti would have difference and insentience like the sun etc.  
He clarifies this very point:  

# 134  
Just as when the sun’s rays contact the great sun-gem, || 21-50 ||  
it emits intense fire, yet neither of the two desires it—  
having seen the lodestone, iron performs action; || 21-51 ||  
neither of the two has desire; in the same way Śiva is the efficient cause.  

# 135  
“Of the two” means the sun and the sun-gem.  
“Performs action” means vibration.  
“Of the two” means iron and lodestone.  
As efficient cause, merely by proximity, He unfolds the universe through His own Śakti.  
One might object: since causeless things cannot occur owing to the fixed laws of place, time, and nature, there must necessarily be some controller of the sun-gem etc.  
True, there is—but that controller is  

# 136  
Too subtle to be perceived, the impeller of both. || 21-52 ||  
That is, the Supreme Lord. “Because of subtlety” means because He is imperceptible. || 21-53 ||  

# 137  
Such a cause of the entire universe is not experienced.  
And this is proper, for if the supreme cause of the universe, the Supreme Lord, were experienced,  
He Himself would be established as the impeller even of the sun-gem etc.;  
but He is not experienced, because His nature is that of the experiencer.  
One might object:  

# 138  
“Indeed, without knowledge entities are not made objects by anyone;  
knowledge itself becomes the known—this is understood.”  

# 139  
According to the teaching of the Kālikā-krama, consciousness-Śakti alone is experienced as the cause in the manifestation of the universe, just as action-Śakti is in construction.  
How then can it be said “the cause is not experienced”?  
True: the Śakti that flows outward is experienced as manifesting the universe,  
but the inner cause of the universe—the oneness of Śiva and Śakti—cannot be delimited according to the previous reasoning. Therefore he says—  

# 140  
But that Śakti is the material cause, perceived everywhere. || 53 ||  
Just as everything perfectly accomplished is seen through the power of action,  
the relation of disturber and disturbed is never directly perceived by anyone. || 21-54 ||  
The wise know that the cause is agitated through intimate union.  

# 141  
“Is perceived” means is clearly experienced.  
Here the word “just as” gives the illustration.  
“Everything” means pots, cloth, etc.  
The relation of disturber and disturbed is the first vibration of Śiva and Śakti suitable for manifesting creation etc.  
And that very thing, through intimate union—through oneness—is agitated, meaning it vibrates in a manner suitable for manifesting creation etc.  
The wise are the venerable Kaṇṭha, Ananteśa, Sadāśiva, etc.  
They know the Lord as the cause, the agent, because the universe is manifested by His own Śakti, and they directly realize Him through complete union.  
Thus it is said in the venerable Svacchanda-tantra:  

# 142  
“Without desire He creates the entire universe, moving and unmoving,  
playfully agitating space with His own splendour, O blessed one.  
That which is declared agitated through intimate union is the material cause.” (Svacch. 11.3-4)  

# 143  
And in the venerable Śrīkaṇṭhī:  

# 144  
“Everything proceeds from the Lord.”  

# 145  
Thus also here:  

# 146  
Without desire Śarva creates everything moving and unmoving through Śakti. || 21-55 ||  

# 147  
Because of His plenitude He has no desire, no craving for fruits; therefore “without desire,” “through Śakti” means solely through His own autonomy, not like a different lord depending on material cause etc.  
As stated:  

# 148  
“But that Śakti is the material cause.” (21-54)  

# 149  
“Everything moving and unmoving.”  
Just as unmoving beings, so too moving beings—all the classes of living creatures in the form of Rudras and Kṣetrajñas—are created by the Blessed Lord, manifested through the variegated concealment of His own nature;  
they are not eternally established as such—this is the intended meaning. || 21-56 ||  
He applies this to the present context:  

# 150  
In the manner thus described, all mantras are born from the three principles—  
named after Śiva, having the form of Śakti, and likewise having the form of the Self. || 56 ||  
They are declared to have three natures, always powerful everywhere,  
all-pervading, possessing all forms. || 21-57 ||  

# 151  
Because, in the manner described, the Supreme Śiva Himself manifests the universe on His own canvas through His own Śakti,  
therefore mantras are born in the three principles beginning with Śiva, are named after Śiva etc., have the nature of Śiva etc.,  
and are endowed with all capacities.  
But not as those of dull intellect say:  

# 152  
“One Śiva is unchanging; His Śakti too is therefore not different from Him;  
they are unable to exist in many forms, or without consciousness they would be subject to change.” (Nā. Kā. 16)  

# 153  
Thus they assert that mantras depend upon atoms, without considering the autonomy of Śiva. || 21-58 ||  
He explains this at length and clearly:  

# 154  
Śiva is the possessor of beginningless splendour, eternal, the first, immovable.  

# 155  
This has already been largely explained earlier.  
And when—  

# 156  
O Goddess, the Lord proceeds forth by will without delay, || 58 ||  

# 157  
then His will-named  

# 158  
supreme, most subtle Śakti, called Unmanā, having the form of Śiva,  

# 159  
having transcended mind, possesses unobstructed flashing of self-luminous light.  
And this very one—  

# 160  
when it agitates the Self which is mere existence and is to be agitated, || 21-59 ||  
is designated Samanā, the Śakti that pervades all paths,  
which, having contracted the universe, creates it again. || 21-60 ||  

# 161  
“Mere existence” is the great reality whose nature is light;  
therefore when Śakti agitates the Self—which is incapable of enduring complete contraction—  
vibrating as the threading of the entire universe from the subtlest void to the earth principle,  
then, having ascended to the station of the supreme knower, because it is mere knowing without any object, it is called Samanā.  
Hence it exists in all paths, vibrating as the first flash;  
therefore it contracts the universe.  
And this contraction means: having manifested as the appearance of void by submerging into identity with itself after contracting,  
it creates by expanding as “this”;  
it vibrates as the great creative Śakti that has internalized the entire panorama of creation and dissolution.  
This is again indicated by the word “again”: it contracts and creates again and again.  
By “having contracted” is indicated the realm of Bhū that pervades void and supra-void;  
by “creates” is indicated the realm of Śakti. || 21-61 ||  
As he says—  

# 162  
The great coiled Śakti is also conventionally designated as the third.

# 163  
By “coiled” it is shown that the universe has been coiled within, with the opening of inner void and the removal of external limitation;  
“conventionally called” means it is thus spoken of in ordinary usage.  
And this Śakti called Unmanā, having vibrated as the power of Samanā and Vyāpinī whose nature is the general manifestation of existence and non-existence after contracting all objects and non-objects,  
desiring to manifest the universe that has the form of signifier and signified in the form of Śakti,  
first vibrates with the general, uncreated, phonemic form that has coiled the signified vibration and the signifier. Thus he says—  
when the explosion that is sound-form, arising from the unseen body of Śiva, || 61 ||  

# 164  
proceeds with extreme speed, filling the universe with sound—  
that sound is the Lord of lords of gods, declared to be Sadāśiva. || 62 ||  

# 165  
The universe consisting of words is clearly manifested from it; therefore it is the explosion, the Word-Brahman.  
Hence it has the form of sound, its nature is sound.  
“From the unseen” means from the unformed, from the supreme uncreated “I”-awareness whose mass is light and bliss, from the very form of Śiva,  
it proceeds with extreme speed like the uninterrupted roar of a rushing river.  
Of what nature? Filling the universe with sound—in the form of the reverberation of a bell, the final sound—making it its own through awareness.  
That very Lord of sound, whose nature is supreme consciousness consisting of the awareness of non-dual “I” and “this” though uncreated, is light—thus it is sound;  
it is Sadāśiva because of the declaration of co-referentiality.  
By the statement “proceeds” it is indicated that the supreme speech-Śakti itself, which is divine, vibrates here.  
And the final sound is also included here. || 21-63 ||  
Now—  

# 166  
Where the sound that has entered the path rests without obstruction,  
it is famous as Nirodhinī, obstructing all gods. || 63 ||  

# 167  
Where the unobstructed, unstruck Lord of sound—which pervades everything—rests,  
submerging its own pervasion and causing the lower pervasion to rise,  
that is the mantric energy called Nirodhinī, famous.  
Of what nature? Obstructing all gods from Brahmā onward by the higher pervasion that supports them.  
As stated in the venerable Svacchanda-tantra:  
“She who obstructs the gods beginning with Brahmā and the lords of gods  
is declared Nirodhinī.” (Svacch. 10.1223)  

# 168  
The glory of being Maheśa does not function for one who is obstructed.  

# 169  
Therefore, solely by the revelation of non-difference, there is multiplicity for those who abide there. Thus he says—  

# 170  
Countless millions of mantras abide there. || 64 ||  

# 171  
Moreover—  

# 172  
Those who enter it obtain……  

# 173  
Yogins who enter that station of Nirodhinī obtain that very thing, not the higher pervasion of non-difference.  
“That” is to be supplied from the repetition.  
And this mantric energy called Nirodhinī, which is nothing but sound, pervading up to the final sound—  

# 174  
...and the bindu is remembered as Īśvara.

# 175  
The supreme Śakti itself, through the pervasion of will-Śakti from Samanā up to the station of Śakti, manifesting the predominance of knowledge-Śakti,  
obstructing the appearance of pervasion up to the final sound consisting of mere sound,  
the non-different awareness of all signifiers,  
assumes the form of the drop which is Īśvara, consisting of the awareness of unity of “I” and “this” that is the clear light of non-different signified.  
And it does not assume the form of the drop immediately after the manifestation of the station of Nirodhinī; rather, in between—  

# 176  
When the nectar of Śiva falls on the head as the cause of creation, ॥ 21-65 ॥ 

# 177  
then nourishment occurs by it; therefore it is remembered as the half-moon.  
Desiring the station of the drop whose nature is the knowledge of non-different signified,  
having withdrawn its own existence by the predominance of concealment of the signified, which is the vibration inclined toward awareness and the energy of sound,  
having resorted to the station of Nirodhinī,  
it first resorts to the half-moon station in which the signified slightly rises—this is the purport.  
The meaning of the words: the nectar belonging to Śiva in the form of sound, to Sadāśiva the Lord,  
the creative energy that is the clear manifestation of “this,” falls upon the head of the drop;  
when it first rises owing to the arising of the drop,  
then that mantric part is called half-moon,  
because nourishment occurs by it;  
for one who has ascended to that station, the full-moon-like creative drop, the station of action-Śakti, arises.  
This half-moon ascends above the station of the drop—  

# 178  
Dissolution of all beings...

# 179  
But descending below sound—  

# 180  
……is indeed the cause of creation. || 21-66 ||  

# 181  
Thus when the action-Śakti in the form of the drop has become clear,  
to show the stage of mantra in which signifier and signified have become separate, he says—  

# 182  
Here the letter Ma is indeed Rudra, the supreme cluster of phonemes.  

# 183  
This drop, manifesting separate existence, first becomes the letter Ma in the form of the “I”-awareness resting upon Māyā.  
Here “Rudra” is the presiding deity—this is the remainder.  
And this Ma, in relation to the present Praṇava, is superior to the letters A and U;  
in relation to other mantras, it is superior even to other letters,  
most excellent, risen high, abiding above,  
the cluster of phonemes, the place of rest of phonemes.  
For the phonemes connected with the condensed syllable,  
possessing the capacity to indicate their respective principles,  
do not enter the pervasion of the drop whose nature is the knowledge of the undivided universe  
until they have assumed the form of the prolonged sound Ma that pierces the knot of Māyā.  
And the cluster of phonemes includes even the notion that the existence of the signified, long, short, or prolonged, is indicated by those phonemes.  
Thus the previously mentioned Śakti, having assumed the form of the mantric part Ma resting upon the knot of Māyā,  
as the very Self of the universe—  

# 184  
when it obtains stability facing itself as the cause of creation, || 21-67 ||  
then the letter U called Pratiṣṭhā is directly Viṣṇu.  

# 185  
“Facing itself” means turned toward its own nature as consciousness,  
because the stage of maintenance is dominated by knowledge,  
and because knowledge has the form of consciousness illuminated by the known—this is stated.  
Hence it is the cause of the stage of creation which is dominated by the object.  
For appearances abiding within consciousness that has the form of knowledge,  
when separately considered, are created as objects.  
Here, in the manner stated in the venerable Mīnakula—  
“Resting in the throat by the union of fish and hook”—  
by the oscillation of the prior and posterior ends,  
resting in the throat-cavity,  
the mantric part called U, having the form of the awareness of U which is the rising consciousness whose nature is the object, is stated.  
And that, in Pratiṣṭhā—  
in the station called Pratiṣṭhā-kalā that includes the twenty-three principles from earth to Prakṛti—  
is the manifestation of the numbering;  
hence it is directly Viṣṇu because it is the awareness of the Lord Viṣṇu-Bhaṭṭāraka who presides over that station and whose nature is consciousness of maintenance.  
By stating this, he teaches that one should understand that the Ma-energy is dominated by the stage of dissolution,  
including the seven principles from Puruṣa to Māyā,  
the pervasion of Vidyā-kalā, etc.  
Now, when consciousness has descended from the throat and reached the lotus of the heart—  

# 186  
When Nivṛtti is everything accomplished, the all-pervading Praṇava, || 21-68 ||  
the letter A called the supreme abode is Brahmā, the lotus-seated.  

# 187  
Nivṛtti is the withdrawal of the creation of principles ending with earth.  
Hence, because of descending order, the letter A of Praṇava is the complete manifestation from A to the end.  
That which is called A is the supreme abode.  
Because it is intensely praised, praised as non-different, considered as non-different, it is the supreme abode.  
Therefore the letter A, though only a part of Praṇava,  
according to the principle “Even a part of Brahman does not transgress its full nature,”  
is declared by co-referentiality to be the supreme abode of Praṇava.  
And this form that is A,  
because it indicates Brahman, because it is the awareness of consciousness dominated by creation,  
and because it is seated in the pericarp of the heart-lotus, is called Brahmā, the lotus-seated.  
Just as the twelve-ended is the supreme abode because the heart too is full consciousness—this statement is appropriate.  
Thus—  

# 188  
This is the creation of mantras belonging to Śiva, the Supreme Self. || 21-69 ||  

# 189  
“Śiva is the possessor of beginningless splendour” (21-59)  

# 190  
up to “the great coiled Śakti” (21-62)  

# 191  
is the form of Śiva-principle; from the final sound to the drop is the form of Śakti-principle;  
from Ma to A is the nature of the Self-principle—the creation of mantras has been stated. || 21-70 ||  
Having thus stated the creation of the great mantra that is Praṇava, dominated by the supreme Paśyantī speech,  
he now states the creation of the Mātṛkā dominated by Madhyamā:  

# 192  
Then, having fifty forms through eight kinds of division,  
the supreme, subtle knowledge-Śakti—wise men know her as Mātṛkā. || 21-71 ||  

# 193  
Eightfold through the division into vargas, fifty-formed through the division of the letters in the vargas.  
And because difference predominates in her, her predominance of speech must be understood.  
Even so, because she contracts all signifier and signified, she is supreme, full;  
because she differs from the gross letters grasped by the ear produced by Vaikharī, she is subtle;  
because she is the cause of the weaving of all signifier and signified in the universe, she is the unknown Mother, Mātṛkā.  
The wise are those who possess knowledge of Mātṛkā according to the principle of the Śiva-sūtras:  
“Awakening of the Mātṛkā-cakra.” (ŚS 2.7) || 70 ||  
Moreover, this Goddess, being non-different in predominance, having the form of supreme speech—  

# 194  
she is the source of all mantras, abiding everywhere like the lower fire-stick.  

# 195  
Thus, although because the order of creation is being presented the pervasion of Praṇava has been stated in reverse order,  
nevertheless in direct order from the heart to the twelve-ended,  
in the order of dissolution of the stages of difference,  
“He grasps everything with Praṇava—  

# 196  
with the energies he unites with Śiva.” (22-14)  
“A and U” (22-21)  

# 197  
according to the principle to be stated, uttering that, from the twelve-ended to the heart,  
by the previously described method, descending through examination of each station,  
flooding the universe with the nectar of Śiva,  
creating the supreme station of Anuttara which is the first sprout-like form of the expansion of Mātṛkā that contracts everything,  
rendering that very universe fit for the great sacrificial oblation through the consecration of the shower of supreme nectar,  
offering it in the supreme abode with the second seed-utterance and awareness,  
in the truth of Agni and Soma that is the complete oneness of upper and lower creation and dissolution,  
he rests with the third seed in his own abode which is Unmanā, supreme Śiva, non-different, consisting of light and bliss. Thus he says—  
he offers incomparable energy, nectar united with creation. || 72 ||  

# 198  
By these two lines, the energy of the two bījas is threaded here. ॥ 71 ॥

# 199  
Precisely because this is so—  

# 200  
therefore that Lord of lords of gods is the lord of nectar, both transcendent and immanent.  

# 201  
“That” refers to the king of mantras Iha.  
Both transcendent and immanent—by this compound His universal nature is stated.  
Moreover—  

# 202  
because He delivers from death, He is called conqueror of death. || 21-72 ||  
Because He nourishes the eggs of the process, He is remembered as Bhairava.  

# 203  
In the process, in the series beginning with the Puruṣa principle,  
the eggs are those of Brahmā, Prakṛti, Māyā, and Śakti;  
because He nourishes them, makes them His own.  
Having thus described the forms of the lord of mantras Iha as lord of nectar etc.,  
to complete the previously presented triad-nature of all mantras, he begins—  

# 204  
In this way the first mantras are remembered, all of boundless splendour. || 21-73 ||  
They exercise authority over the entire universe, O beloved;  
they liberate from transmigration and unite with the supreme Śiva. || 21-74 ||  
Because they have the dharma of contemplating and protecting, therefore they are remembered as mantras.  

# 205  
The word “thus” refers to the previously mentioned lord of mantras and his energy.  
Therefore all mantras that were stated—beginning with lord of nectar etc.—  
whose energy predominates according to the previously described method,  
whose splendour is boundless nectar, the essence of supreme nectar,  
therefore, because their nature is the light of consciousness,  
they exercise authority—creation etc.—over the universe;  
chiefly, however, they perform grace that reveals liberation from bonds and identity with Śiva.  
Hence, according to the etymology stated, because they possess the quality of contemplating and protecting, they are called mantras.  
Precisely because this is so—  

# 206  
Therefore mantras are all-pervading, always givers, born from the three principles. || 21-75 ||  
Having the form of Śiva, Śakti, and Self, they perpetually bestow grace.  

# 207  
All-pervading like the knower of the field, because there is no limitation;  
always givers like Vijñānākala, because agency is concealed;  
perpetually bestowing grace because they have the form of Śiva, Śakti, and Self;  
they are born—manifested—in the three principles.  
Moreover—  

# 208  
Through the power of Śiva and Śakti they carry off the servitude to Śiva. || 21-76 ||  

# 209  
They perform constriction and grace, and carry off the servitude to Śiva—this is the compound of qualifiers. || 21-77 ||  
But for knowers and yogins—  

# 210  
Merely known, they bestow fruits, giving enjoyment and liberation.  

# 211  
He expounds in detail the nature of mantras as having the form of Śiva, Śakti, and Self:  

# 212  
That they know everything and are all-powerful || 77 ||  
is declared to be their Śiva-nature……  

# 213  
All-powerfulness is their universal nature.  

# 214  
……power-nature is all-doership.  

# 215  
Power is that by which something is possible—autonomy.  
He clarifies this very point:  

# 216  
All-grace-doership, bestowing fruit everywhere. || 21-78 ||  

# 217  
Everywhere—in each principle etc.—the bestowal of fruit; the designation is dominated by meaning. || 79 ||  

# 218  
Their Self-nature is their own form, remembered as the threefold means.  
Mantra, contemplation, and gesture……  

# 219  
That which is the form of the means—worship of the mantra-deity—  
resting upon vital energy, intellect, and body as mantra-utterance, contemplation, and gesture-means,  
is the threefold Self-nature, the limited nature of mantras.  
As stated in the venerable Mālinī-vijaya: “Utterance, contemplation, etc.” (MVT 2-21) etc.  
And this threefold—  

# 220  
……means enjoined by scripture. || 21-79 ||  

# 221  
He shows this triad in detail:  

# 222  
Initiation, consecration of the maṇḍala, worship, recitation,  
homa-rite, and what is to be written, the action of contemplation and concentration. || 21-80 ||  
Binding of gestures, and yoga; worship is oneness of action.  

# 223  
Initiation, maṇḍala, and consecration such as infusion etc.—this is a collection.  
What is to be written is the yantra.  
This is the end of the elaboration of mantra.  
Concentration is the elaboration of contemplation.  
Binding of gestures is for yoga whose nature is one-pointedness of mind;  
yoga culminates in union—this is stated as the elaboration of gesture.  
Oneness of action is the elaboration of all three in the form of union of mantra, union of channels, and supreme fusion.  
Having thus established the triad-nature of mantras, he concludes:  

# 224  
Thus mantras have been declared, authoritative everywhere. || 21-81 ||  

# 225  
In accordance with the three principles, for enjoyment and liberation, and for enjoyment—this is auspicious.  
Through perfect pronunciation, through pervasion, owing to rest in the supreme station—  

# 226  
bestowing enjoyment and liberation, both, which are non-dual and unequalled.  

# 227  
We praise that supreme Eye of Śarva that protects the universe,  
lord of all the circles of the followers,  
the supreme lord whose nature is the three principles—  
may it conquer, consisting of the nectar of supreme awakening!  

Thus ends the twenty-first chapter in the Netra-udyota  
composed by the venerable great supreme teacher, the ācārya Śrī Kṣemarāja,  
in the venerable Netra-tantra. || 21-82 ||  

Thus, on the Śrī Netra Tantra,  
in the *Netrodyota* composed by the venerable Kṣemarāja,  
who is supreme among the great Ācāryas devoted to Maheśvara,  
this concludes the twenty-first chapter:
