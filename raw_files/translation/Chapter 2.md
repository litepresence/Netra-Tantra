Second Chapter
Neṭrodyotaḥ: The Illumination of the Eye

# 2

He who is sung in the hymns as the Eight-Formed (Aṣṭamūrti),  
the All-Formed (Viśvamūrti), and yet the Formless (Amūrti)—  
to that Eye which is the very embodiment of Mantra,  
we bow; for it is the consciousness-body of the Great Lord.

# 3

When the Lord had said, “What more do you wish to ask?” and thus granted her leave, the blessed Goddess—who had already realised the truth, who repeated it as a prelude, and who, out of compassion, desired to protect the world—wishing to reveal the true nature of the Mantra, spoke:

# 4

Thus have I heard from Thy mouth, O God,
that the supreme Reality is utterly peaceful,
the abode of immeasurable qualities,
and the heroic power that bestows grace upon all. (1)

O Blessed One, Lord of lords, cause of grace to the worlds!
All this universe—born of the three wombs,
comprising beasts, men, and gods— (2-1)
is tormented by mental and physical ailments,
afflicted by the fear of poisonous beings,
beset by hundreds of untimely deaths,
accompanied by fever, cough, and consumption. (2-2)

In the worlds of Bhūḥ, Bhuvaḥ, and the human realm,
beings from Brāhmaṇas downwards
are filled with hundreds of sorrows and defects.
Whence, O All-pervading Lord, can happiness come to them? (2-3)

# 5

Their lifespan is measured according to the yuga.

# 6

Strengthened by the might of Thy own splendour and power,
they (the hostile beings) seek to slay them. (2-4)

Tormented by diseases of countless kinds,
out of compassion, for the welfare of living beings,
O Lord of the universe, teach the means
whereby they may be wholly liberated. (2-5)

# 7

(The invocations etc. are as before.)
In the previous chapter Thou hast declared the supreme Power that is distinguished by perfect peace and other qualities, and which Thou hast proclaimed from Thy own mouth as the bestower of grace upon all. If that be so, O Blessed One who bestowest grace upon the universe, the fourteen-fold creation of beings which is overrun by diseases and the like, and the beings from Brāhmaṇas downwards in the worlds of Bhūḥ, Bhuvaḥ, and men—who are filled with innumerable sorrows and with defects such as attachment and hatred, whose lifespan is limited according to the yuga, who are swollen with the strength of Thy own splendour and power, i.e. who, together with diseases, are desired to be slain by Śākinīs, Bhūtas, Yakṣas, Grahas, and the like—out of compassion teach the beneficent means for the grace of all these beings, whereby all these who are sorely afflicted may be liberated on every side and all their calamities cease. (2-6)

Thereupon:

# 8

By whatever path, through knowledge-yoga or through mantra— (6)

Whatever Thou seest, O Lord of gods,
declare that means unto me.

# 9

O Lord of gods, my own Self!
Relying upon knowledge, yoga, and mantra,
by whatever gross, subtle, or supreme means
Thou seest that highest good which I have asked about—
declare Thou that means.

# 10

Here the introducer of the Tantra establishes the connection:

# 11

Hearing thus the words of the Goddess,
Śaṅkara smiled and spoke: (2-7)

# 12

He smiled—meaning: “I shall now teach with the power of yoga”;
because he was commanded to do so, he laughed with the rapture
of the flashing forth of the Supreme Self;
or again, in the manner previously described,
having entered the absorption of the contemplation of Nāda,
he gave a great laugh, thinking:
“What is there that is impossible for this Blessed Lord?”
and thus he smiled. (2-8)

The Blessed Lord said:

# 13

O Goddess, possessed by exceeding compassion,
Thou askest me here.
Never have I been asked by anyone,
nor have I ever revealed this to anyone. (8)

# 14

Because Thou hast asked me out of exceeding compassion,
and because I have never been asked by anyone,
therefore, following the rule “One who has not been asked should not teach anyone,”
I too have never revealed it to anyone. (9)

Therefore:

# 15

Among all the true mantras that exist,
this is celebrated as the Eye.
Yet it lies in my heart, perceived by no one—
exceedingly difficult to obtain. (2-9)

Today I shall declare it to Thee—
threefold, supreme, unchanging,
attainable through mantra, yoga, and knowledge,
bestowing liberation and siddhis, the highest boon. (2-10)

# 16

Thou hast asked about the nature of the Netra.
Among the more than thirty-five million true mantras
that exist principally, and among all objects of knowledge,
this is celebrated as the Eye,
just as The Eye is principal among the other senses
and illumines all existing things.
As it will be said later:

# 17

“The God who is common to all Śiva’s forms
bestows the fruit of all siddhis;
he is remembered as the very life of all mantras.” (13.44)

# 18

This, remaining in my heart at the time of teaching all scriptures,
has never been known by anyone.
For the non-dual Supreme whose nature is all-in-all,
who is expressed cryptically and in aphorisms in all scriptures,
is extremely difficult to comprehend for those steeped in differences.
Because it is attainable only through mantra, yoga, and knowledge—
by gross, subtle, and supreme means—
it is threefold, eternal, bestowing enjoyment and liberation.
Today, to Thee who art worthy, I shall assuredly declare it.
Thus, with means and purpose, he again specially promises
to expound the true nature of the reality—
because this teaching is of the utmost value. (2-11)

Therein:

# 19

First I shall declare the mantra-body
endowed with the triad of siddhis—
together with the six limbs beginning with the heart,
united with the future Padmāmṛta-mudrā,
supreme, the cause of universal protection and grace. (11)

# 20

That supreme form which has been undertaken—
whose very essence is the mantra,
because it is the pure I-consciousness of awareness—
endowed with the threefold siddhi distinct from earthly, atmospheric, and heavenly ones,
together with the six limbs beginning with the heart,
united with the Padmāmṛta-mudrā that is yet to come,
which accomplishes universal protection and grace—
this I shall declare.
Thus is the promise of this chapter concerning the mantra. (2-12)

Moreover:

# 21

By Bhūtas, Yakṣas, Grahas, madness,
hosts of Śākinīs and Yoginīs,
by the Bhaginīs, Rudramātṛs, Ḍāviḍās, Ḍāmarikās, and others, (12)
by the Rūpikās, by epilepsy,
by Piśācas in countless numbers,
by Brahmarakṣas, fierce Grahas, and others—
even if sealed by crores of them, (2-13)

# 22

overwhelmed by untimely deaths,  
sought to be slain by the nooses of Time—

# 23

kings, princes, royal wives in great numbers,  
all beings from Brāhmaṇas downwards,  
afflicted by the fear of every defect—  
by the mere remembrance of which they are liberated:  
that I shall declare unto Thee.

# 24

If beings are sealed by Bhūtas and the like,
have fallen into untimely death,
are desired to be slain by the nooses of Time,
kings and others who have reached their appointed death,
those whom they protect—from Brāhmaṇas downwards—
tormented by fear arising from every defect and disease:
the nature of that mantra by whose mere remembrance they are liberated—
that I now declare unto Thee. This is the connection.

Bhūtas dwell in empty wells, solitary trees, crossroads, etc.
Yakṣas are powerful special beings.
Grahas are child-seizing Grahas, possession-Grahas, etc.
Madness shows disordered fancies, causeless anger, desire, etc.
Śākinī attracts animal blood etc. for changing form.
Yoginīs are goddesses born from the seats.
Bhaginīs arise from portions of Brahmā and the rest.
Rudramātṛs are the mothers of Rudra—Brahmā and the rest.
Ḍāviḍās and Ḍāmarikās are described in the glorious Sarvavīra:

# 25

Beginning with:

# 26

“Knowledge of another’s mind,
changing of form,
and greed for nectar—
know her as Rudra-Ḍākinī.

# 27

Ḍāviḍās are to be known as similar,
devoted to secret worship and practice;
they enjoy but do not kill,
ever seeking weaknesses.

Ḍāmarikās are different:
their minds fixed on mantra and its goal;
they partake of the supreme nectar
and make humans their vehicles.
They roam the entire earth,
assuming manifold forms.”

# 28

Thus they are defined.
Rūpikās are harmful.
Epilepsy causes sudden falling, loss of consciousness, foaming, etc.
Piśācas dwell in cremation grounds etc., with torch-like faces.
Brahmarakṣas are a special class of Rākṣasas.
Grahas are planets such as Mars that have gone to inauspicious positions.
Their nature will be shown in detail later. (2-16)

Now he speaks of the proper procedure for extracting the mantra:

# 29

On ground that is level and pure,
smeared with sandal, aguru,
rich with the fragrance of camphor,
served with the perfume of saffron, (16)

the Ācārya, serene in mind,
smeared with sandal and aguru,
adorned with turban and other ornaments,
of exceedingly great intelligence, (2-17)

having drawn an eight-petalled lotus,
should therein write the Mātṛkā.

# 30

Pure: unmixed in colour.
With sandal etc.: meaning worshipped with sandal and the rest as the foundational Śakti.
Serene: whose mind has attained purity through absorption in Śiva.
Smeared with sandal etc.: one who has performed the daily obligations.
Of exceedingly great intelligence: knower of the true principle of the Mātṛkā.
The unknowing mother is Mātṛkā, the progenitrix of all mantras etc. (2-18)

How? he says:

Placing the three-bodied OṀ in the centre,
he should write the groups of letters beginning from the east. (18)

The three-bodied: OṀkāra.
In the centre: in the pericarp.
The groups: ka-varga, ca-varga, ṭa-varga, ta-varga, pa-varga, ya-varga, śa-varga—
in order, ending with the north-east.

Having written thus, in the very order of recitation:

# 31

He should worship with supreme devotion,
with flowers, incense, and other offerings in abundance.
O Goddess, mother of all mantras,
he should then extract the deity of the mantra. (2-19)

# 32

Extract: meaning after the worship. (2-20)

He declares the extraction:

# 33

From the beginning of the universe to the end of universal form,
the universe-destroying Time, the nectar-bulb,
light, sound, the Supreme Energy,
Śiva—abiding together as one. (20)

# 34

Beginning of the universe: the first letter (A).
End of universal form—of Māyā whose form is the universe—
the final letter of Īkāra, i.e. the vowel U.
Universe-destroying Time: the word for Time, M.
Alternatively: the beginning of the universe is the Creator Brahmā,
hence the letter A; the end of Viṣṇu who has universal form
is determination, hence U; Rudra the destroyer of the universe
is M by denotation. Thus extraction also follows the signified.
Nectar: the bindu which is the identity-in-non-difference of all that is knowable in the universe.
Bulb: the ardha-candra.
Light: the nirodhikā, a clear line.
Sound: the nāda in the form of Ha-Kala, the I-consciousness of non-difference of all that is expressible.
Supreme Energy: the clear line situated between two bindus.
Here by nāda is included nādānta;
by Supreme Energy are included the lower and upper powers—
Vyāpinī and Samanā.
Śiva: the consciousness of non-difference from the universe described above,
to be seen as the supreme nāda above all.
This is the order of the parts of the dust (dhūli).

# 35

As in the heart-order:
“Brahmā, Upendra, Hara, the egg of the universe—
expressed by A U M—
for the ascent of the nāda-ground,
the line of the moon-crested one melting of its own knowable,
ending in nirodha.
When the knowable melts away
in the upper and lower places of the knower of nāda,
the clear inner upper sound,
the plane of touch-pervasion—
we praise that state where mind is absorbed in That.”

By the words “abiding together as one”
is shown that the entire aggregate of objects is of the nature of the single Praṇava. (2-21)

He declares its greatness:

# 36

By this everything is strung together
as gems upon a thread.
From this have arisen all mantras—
seventy million and more that possess authority. (21)

# 37

Strung together: woven, i.e. pervaded.
Seventy million mantras: in the first creation only that many had authority.
Afterwards, however:

# 38

“At the very birth of the world
three and a half crores of mantras
were appointed by Śiva.
Having bestowed grace upon the hosts of atomic beings,
they went to the state free from affliction.” (1.40-41)

# 39

Thus according to the earlier scripture, three and a half additional crores were authorised. (2-22)

He extracts the second seed:

# 40

The word “Citra-bhānu-pada” ending,
within the crescent-moon fragment,
that with the goad placed above,
then transversely the end of “ga”, joined above. (22)

# 41

“Citra-bhānu-pada”: the lotus-word, the Āgneya petal;
the letter belonging to ka-varga ending there, i.e. Ṅ.
Within the crescent-moon fragment: in the middle of the ardha-candra.
Thus, following the extraction, the letter Ja of agni-soma nature arises.
“Of that goad” (O-kāra): above it is to be placed.
Transversely “ga”: Vāyu; the letter Ma in its petal,
in relation to pa-varga; thereby joined above with bindu.
Here the bindu is the threader of all objects beginning with ardha-candra. (23)

He declares its greatness:

# 42

This is That supreme abode;
this is That supreme nectar.

# 43

Meaning: compact mass of consciousness and bliss.

He extracts the third:

# 44

That which is declared the supreme,
the nectar famed in the world, (23)

united with the digit of ambrosial moon-juice,
resembling the splendour of the full moon.

# 45

“That which”: that which is perfectly one’s own experience,
through complete manifestation of its nature
and through the delight of absorption—
thus it is declared the supreme.
Nectar famed in the world: the letter Sa, known in the world as the nectar-seed.
Digit of ambrosial moon-juice: the sixteenth, the supreme I-consciousness, Parā vimarśaśakti.
United with it: making the existence of the universe consist of supreme nectar,
like the splendour of the full moon.

# 46

By the words “That which is declared the supreme”
the greatness of the third seed is stated.

# 47

He declares the greatness of the complete Lord of all mantras:

# 48

This is That supreme abode;
this is That supreme state, (2-24)

this is That supreme heroic power,
this is That supreme nectar,
the supreme lustre among all lustres,
the supreme light among lights, (2-25)

the shining God of all the universe,
the supreme cause—
creator, sustainer, and destroyer.
There is no warrior equal to Him. (2-26)

# 49

He is the abode of all mantras,
the repository of all qualities of siddhi.

# 50

The words “this” and “that” are for recognising the nature of the Self.
Supreme abode: the light of consciousness.
State: the ground of repose.
Heroic power: capacity.
Nectar: bliss.
Among lustres such as the fire of Time,
among lights such as sun, moon, pole-star—
of the entire universe in the form of the six paths,
the shining God, the supreme independent cause
that illumines on its own screen of consciousness
the universe which, though not different from itself,
appears as though different.
Hence He is the mighty one.
There exists none equal to Him who performs the five acts of creation etc.,
for He alone is the compact mass of pure, autonomous consciousness.
Sadāśiva and the rest, being mere reflections of Him,
perform creation etc. only by the sprinkling of this sovereignty
and by His will alone.
As will be said:

# 51

“By Śakti the Lord, being all-pervading,
performs everything.
The Lord is the instrumental cause,
like the action of a sun-crystal.
But Śakti, agitated and inseparably united,
is the material cause.” (21.50-51)

This will be explained there.
Abode of mantras: because all consist essentially of the heroic power that is consciousness-bliss.
Repository of all qualities of siddhi desired by sādhakas
and of all qualities such as omniscience.

Now:

I shall now declare the limbs
by being equipped with which one attains suinment. (2-27)

Limbs: heart and the rest.
Equipped: one who has undertaken them in daily and occasional rites.
Attains siddhi: the sādhaka etc. obtains enjoyment and liberation;
the Ācārya bestows them upon the disciple etc.—this is the meaning.
By this is shown the Pāṭalī connection
for the future daily and other rites. (2-28)

Therein:

# 52

The middle letter of Kṛtānta,
followed by the fifth of the king of vowels,
whose head is the end of Prabhañjana—
this heart bestows all siddhis. (28)

# 53

Of Kṛtānta: the ca-varga in the yāmya petal;
its middle letter: Ja.
King of vowels: Indra; the fifth in its petal, the a-varga: U-kāra,
which follows below.
End of Prabhañjana: Ma with bindu as head.
Thus this second seed itself is determined as the heart-mantra;
because of its great greatness it bestows all siddhis. (29)

He declares the head-mantra:

# 54

Ending with the soma-petal,
united with the first of the fire-letter,
joined with Praṇava—
this is the head(-mantra).

# 55

Soma-petal: the ya-varga in the soma direction;
its ending letter: Va.
First of the fire-letter: of the repha of agneya: Ya.
Joined with Praṇava.
Thus Va-Ya-OṀ—by uniting these three:
this is the head-mantra.

Then:

# 56

…united with the end of Anila, together with Māyā—
this is remembered as the crest (Śikhā). (29)

# 57

Māyā: Ī.
With the end of Anila: as before, with bindu.
Remembered as the crest—by unbroken tradition. (2-30)

He declares the armour:

# 58

Ending with the Īśa-letter, above Īśvara,
joined above with half of twelve,
then united with Śiva-Śakti and nāda—
that is the supreme armour. (30)

# 59

Īśa-petal: śa-varga in Īśa direction; its ending letter: Ha
(Kṣa being separate as a conjunct).
Or: Īśa meaning the mouth of Īśāna, whose ending letter is Kṣa.
That very one above Īśvara—Īśvara meaning Bhaṭṭāraka: bindu above the head.
Half of twelve: the sixth vowel, U-kāra, joined above.
By “Śiva-Śakti” is declared the entire object the highest object of all mantras.
Armour: Kavaca. (2-31)

He declares The Eye:

# 60

Praṇava with the first of Bhairava,
with the ever-moving one placed on the head—
this Eye-mantra, greatly fierce,
destroys all sins. (31)

# 61

This mantra is proclaimed as the “weapon” (astra) conjoined with a-Jīva-ka-ṭa.

# 62

Because no living soul (Jīva) exists in it, the syllable pha is called a-Jīva(ka); it is the letter of dissolution (saṁhāra-varṇa). That very pha is perfectly united with the letter ṭa, which is lifeless (aprāṇa), devoid of any vowel (anac-ka), and which embodies the purest essence of dissolution. Thus the compound “a-Jīva-ka” is pronounced twice.
He now concludes the section:

# 63

The six limbs (aṅga-ṣaṭka) of the King of Mantras have been fully expounded; they bestow accomplishment (siddhi). ‖ 32 ‖

# 64

The very essence of its virile power has been perfectly declared. The phrase “bestowing accomplishment” is to be understood as referring to the worshippers. By this statement the transition to the next chapter is indicated. May it be auspicious! ‖ 2-33 ‖
We praise that sole Great Lord of all mantras, the Eye of the Lord—
whose limbs are made of the six qualities beginning with omniscience,
who is the perfect, beautiful, compact mass of nothing but the light of pure consciousness,
who completely accomplishes the five cosmic acts,
the Eye of Śiva himself.
Thus ends the second chapter, entitled “Extraction of the Mantra”,
in the illustrious Netrodyota commentary on the venerable Netra-tantra,
composed by the eminent supreme master of the Mahāmaheśvara tradition,
the venerable Kṣemarāja. ‖ 33 ‖

# 65

Fully the essence of power has been declared.
Bestowing siddhi: upon the worshippers, by implication.
By this is indicated the connection with the next chapter.
Auspiciousness. (2-33)

Consisting of the six limbs that are made of the six qualities beginning with omniscience,
complete, beautiful, the sole compact mass of consciousness-light—
the Eye-mantra of the Lord who performs all the five acts without remainder—
to that sole Great Lord of all mantras we bow.

Thus in the glorious Netra Tantra,
in the Netrodaya commentary composed
by the great supreme teacher, the venerable Kṣemarāja,
the second chapter entitled “Extraction of the Mantra”. (33)

Third Chapter
“Netrodayaḥ”

# 66

That which shines forth in the rising of the Eye
for the daily worship of the great-souled—
which removes all afflictions without remainder—
we salute that Blue-Red One.

# 67

From the earlier statement “bestowing siddhi”,
in order to complete the proper procedure and establish authority,
and to reveal the daily worship, the Blessed Lord said:

# 68

Now I shall declare the worship
whereby the King of Mantras attains siddhi.

# 69

Now: after the form of the mantra to be worshipped has been revealed.
Worship: inner and outer sacrifice.
Attains siddhi: becomes the bestower of enjoyment and liberation.

Therein, since one who has not bathed has no right to worship:

# 70

First one should perform bathing
that destroys all sins. (2)


# 71

Thus, on the Śrī Netra Tantra,  
in the *Netrodyota* composed by the venerable Kṣemarāja,  
who is supreme among the great Ācāryas devoted to Maheśvara,  
this concludes the second chapter:
**Mystic Statement of the Amriteshvara Mantra**
