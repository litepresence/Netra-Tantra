Seventeenth Chapter
Neṭrodyotaḥ: The Illumination of the Eye

# 2

With wondrous rays that flash forth in manifold forms,
filled with the nectar of its own radiance,
the glorious, supreme Netra of Īśa,
conqueror of Death, triumphs and removes all fear.

# 3

Out of compassion, and in order to teach other cakras as well for the purpose of protection,
the glorious Bhagavān spoke:

# 4

Now, therefore, I shall explain the Cakrarāja of great power.

# 5

“Atha” (now) means after the subjects already taught in the previous chapter.
“Ataḥ” (therefore) means: because there are many persons worthy of grace,
the intention is that at least some of them may somehow receive grace.

In this regard:

# 6

The wise practitioner should, as before, conceive the Jīva in the center. ||16||  
Having placed the Prāṇa within it, he should arrange the final letter (kṣa) within the set of letters.  
Then the final letter (kṣa) is to be placed outside that;  
outside that, the middle letter (ha);  
outside that, the first letter (sa). ||17-1||  
The first letter (sa) is then to be placed in the pericarp.  
The vowels are to be worshipped in the filaments,  
the aṅgas (limbs of the mantra) in the petals, as before. ||17-2||  
Outside, having drawn a jar (kalaśa) that contains both lotuses (upper and lower) within it,  
he should worship it according to the previous method,  
devoted to japa, homa, and archana. ||17-3||  
He quickly accomplishes whatever is desired; of this there is no doubt.

# 7

“Pūrvavat” means: the royal mantra written above, enclosed by the letters of the target (sādhya),
and the name made to end in the second case (dative), as before.

# 8

“…joined with the word rakṣā (protect).” (17-11)

# 9

Because this will be stated later, the word “rakṣā” is appropriately placed inside the Jīva (the letter sa).  
The Prāṇa (ha) is placed inside it, and the final letter kṣa inside that.  
Then, outside this, the final letter kṣa is written;  
outside that, the middle letter ha;  
outside that, the first letter sa.  
Having written thus, it is placed in the pericarp.  
In the filaments, the vowels in order beginning from the east;  
in the petals, the aṅgas beginning with the heart, as before—  
“as before” meaning in the order beginning with the south-east, etc.  
Outside such a lotus, a jar is drawn,  
containing both the upper and lower lotuses in its interior.  
One who is devoted to worship, japa, and homa of the mantra with its aṅgas and root (mūla)  
quickly accomplishes the desired aim.  
Here, the mantra ending in namaḥ is used for worship and japa;  
for homa, however, it ends in svāhā—  
this is the meaning of “pūrvavat”.

Moreover, this cakra:

# 10

…bestows all peace, grants nourishment and good fortune,
confers longevity and virility, and destroys fever and disease.
It brings victory to kings who are terrified of enemy kingdoms. ||17-5||
For royal women, their sons, brahmins, and all others,
this protection must be performed in every way—
it destroys all afflictions. ||6||

# 11

The meaning is clear. ||7||

The name should also be written in a row, with letters inserted alternately, O Beloved.

# 12

At the beginning and end, the root mantra accompanied by a word of the vauṣaṭ class should be placed. ||7||
It should be worshipped as before with abundant white and auspicious offerings.
Instantly one is freed from diseases;
even if death has already seized him, he is released. ||17-8||

# 13

A name such as Devadatta, “with letters inserted alternately” means the root mantra is placed between each letter.
Having written it, the root mantra accompanied by a vauṣaṭ-class word
is placed at the beginning and end, both in direct and reverse order.
He who performs the great sacrifice (bhūriyāga) with white flowers, etc.,
worships it “as before”, that is, with one-pointed concentration through worship, japa, homa, etc. ||17-9||

# 14

The mantra ending in a vauṣaṭ-class word should be written in the eight directions on a white surface.
On beautiful birch-bark or birch, the name is placed in the centre as before. ||9||
Outside it, joined with the word rakṣā, a lunar circle;
the final letter of the mantra, which is amṛta,
abiding in the sixteen kalās. ||17-10||
Having filled the circle with them, a jar is placed outside.
Outside that jar, the moon and sun
are placed in the city of Purandara (the square). ||17-11||
It should be written with saffron, rocanā, and milk-sugar.

# 15

“In the directions” means on the petals of the lotus;  
“in the centre” means in the pericarp;  
“as before” means enclosed by the letters of the target, as in the first procedure.  
Outside that (the pericarp), at the edge of the pericarp, a lunar circle (ṭha);  
the final letter of the mantra is sa;  
“amṛta” refers to the supreme amṛta that will be described;  
it abides in the sixteen kalās from ā to visarga.  
With those kalās conjoined with sa,  
the lunar circle (ṭha) is filled.  
“Outside” means this lotus is drawn inside the jar.  
Outside the jar, the moon and sun (ṭha and ḍha)  
are placed in the city of Purandara, the square,  
arranged with the insignia of the thunderbolt.  
This is for pacification and destruction of previous afflictions.  
Again, above this very same, one should meditate on a jar full of milk  
from which amṛta flows—this is for nourishment (puṣṭi).

# 16

Having worshipped according to rule, remaining in the state of peace as before… ||17-12||

# 17

The guru who is engaged in the rite of pacification should be attentive— this is the meaning. ||17-13||

And this:

# 18

…is declared to be the royal protection that destroys all afflictions.

# 19

When this is performed, the special rule is:

# 20

For the protection of a king, one should offer in homa
sesamum mixed with milk, white sugar, fragrant substances, and ghee,
in a fire fuelled by the wood of milk-giving trees—
thus he (the king) obtains peace. ||17-14||

# 21

“With the procedure for royal protection” means with that purpose fixed in mind as the motive.
“He” refers to the king. ||15||

Moreover:

# 22

When a man has been seized by death under the power of time,
having seen him, a sacrifice performed as before
in the aforesaid maṇḍala, furnished with all necessary substances,
destroys death. ||17-15||

# 23

It is this very cakra inside the jar, with the mantra-lord placed as described,
that is called “destroyer of death”.

When this has been worshipped:

# 24

One swiftly escapes death through the power of this mantra. ||17-16||
That very same (cakra) should be written on birch-bark
with white sugar, milk, rocanā, and saffron. ||17-17||
Smeared with honey, it is placed in a golden jar, well concealed.
Above it, a second beautiful jar full of milk
from which amṛta flows should be meditated upon and placed
by one desiring nourishment. ||17-18||

# 25

“That very same” means the same cakra that was inside the jar.
By saying this, he indicates that this pertains to the sacrifice performed immediately after the previous one.
By saying “with milk, etc.”, he instructs that the previous sacrifice is accomplished with rice-flour.
“Smeared with honey” means coated with honey.
“Amṛta” means milk itself flowing
and being released downward inside the lower jar according to the proper sequence of retention.

He for whom this is performed with his name:

# 26

…through a practice of seven nights becomes conqueror of death. ||17-19||

# 27

Likewise:

# 28

One whose body has wasted away becomes full
at the end of a fortnight, like the moon.
He does not come under the power of death—
my word is true, not false. ||17-20||
The name of the target, enclosed by the letters of the mantra,
joined with the word rakṣā,
should be worshipped in the centre;
make the target immortal as before. ||17-21||

# 29

“The target” means the person conceived through the name;
“immortalisation as before” means on the eight petals as previously,
with the royal mantra ending in vauṣaṭ for nourishment. ||17-22||

When it has become thus:

# 30

Envelop it with the self (maka),
then again with the watery (vaka),
outside that with the remainder of the kalās (ṭaka),
and finally with the complete one (ṭhaka). ||22||

# 31

With the self, meaning the letter ma that denotes puruṣa;
then with the watery letter va;
then with the remainder of the kalās, letter ṭa;
then with the complete, letter ṭha.
“Jar” is a corrupt reading. ||17-23||

Thereafter:

# 32

Outside that, Purandara (the square)
twice in the range of the four directions;
that maṇḍala should be joined,
placed in the midst of the vajra-maṇḍala. ||23||

# 33

Purandara is the square; its maṇḍala.
“Twice” means two times two.
“In the four directions” means above the square another square is placed
so that an eight-pointed configuration results.
That eight-pointed maṇḍala is placed in the midst of the vajra-maṇḍala—
meaning, having made a square maṇḍala with the vajra insignia, place it in the centre. ||17-24||

He for whom this is performed with his name:

# 34

…is protected by the Lord of Amṛta…

# 35

From the “ca” (and), he is made immortal.

For such a target:

# 36

…never at any time do Yoginīs, bhūtas, Yakṣas, rākṣasas, or violent beings become sources of fear. ||24||

# 37

He teaches another procedure:

# 38

Inside the jar, the name should be written
and placed upon a lotus.
On its back, an inverted lotus should be drawn as before. ||17-25||
That which resides in its pericarp should be written
according to the downward-facing method.
Meditate on amṛta flowing from it,
complete and facing all directions. ||17-26||
Conceive Amṛteśa as having entered through the orifice of the jar
and having entered the heart of that person,
filling all his channels. ||17-27||

# 39

Inside the jar, upon the pericarp of the lotus, the name of the target is written.
“As before” means upon the jar.
“That” means the Amṛteśa mantra residing in the pericarp of the upper lotus
is written facing downward;
meditate on amṛta flowing through the downward path of the bindu.
And conceive that amṛta, having entered the heart of the target
through the orifice of the jar at the place of the name,
filling all his channels.

For him:

# 40

…nourishment arises instantly, even if the man’s body has wasted away.

# 41

He teaches yet another:

# 42

In a row, the mantra should be written
with each letter placed in the middle. ||17-28||
The name of the target should be written…

# 43

“With each letter in the middle” means written with the mantra placed between each letter;
that is placed outside.

# 44

…in the directions, Mṛtyujit should be written.
Having drawn a lotus as before,
the six aṅgas as before, O Beloved. ||17-29||
Having joined them, worship with power
according to the extent of one’s resources.
With entirely white offerings,
he becomes the chief of mantras that removes all suffering. ||30||
No deliberation is needed here.

# 45

Having drawn the lotus, the Lord Mṛtyujit (the mantra ending in vauṣaṭ)
is placed on its petals “as before”;
outside it another lotus is drawn,
and the six aṅgas previously mentioned are joined on the petals as before—
thus this cakra is worshipped.
“Having drawn a lotus” is like the crow’s-Eye method.
By “no deliberation is needed here”,
he indicates that this yields fruit without doubt, as previously— auspicious.

# 46

We praise the glorious Netra of Śaṅkara,
manifested in the form playfully devised,
bestowing all protection without hindrance.

# 47

Thus ends the seventeenth chapter in the glorious Netra-tantra
with the Netrodyota commentary composed by the great supreme teacher,
the venerable Kṣemarāja. ||17-31||

Eighteenth Chapter
“Illumination of the Netra”

# 48

The supreme Eye-Lakṣmī of the Great Lord—
whose Self flashes forth as the sole source of complete enjoyment and liberation—
somehow triumphs, removing all torment of the universe.

# 49

In order to introduce another topic by repeating what was said before,
the glorious Devī spoke:

# 50

O Lord, O God of gods, delighting in the welfare of all beings,
O Lord of the gods, You are the protector and the cause of grace to all. ||17||
O Great Lord, You have taught the pervasion of the paths within the mantras.
O Lord of the universe, if You are pleased with me, O Master,
please tell me the application of mantras in nailing (kīlana), etc.
O Lord, You have only hinted at it. ||18-1||

# 51

Thus, on the Śrī Netra Tantra,  
in the *Netrodyota* composed by the venerable Kṣemarāja,  
who is supreme among the great Ācāryas devoted to Maheśvara,  
this concludes the seventeenth chapter:
