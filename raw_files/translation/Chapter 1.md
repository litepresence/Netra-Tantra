First Chapter
Neṭrodyotaḥ: The Illumination of the Eye

We praise that Lord of the Eye (Netranātha), whose:

* gates are the nine apertures of the body,
* dwelling-place is the heart,
* abode is the temple of being,
* Gaṇeśa is the mind,
* gurus are sound and the rest (the objects),
* ten vāyus are the vital energies,
* essence is the foundational Śakti (Ādhāraśakti);
  who, together with the power of reflective awareness (vimarśaśakti), possesses the sixfold attributes (ṣaḍguṇya) and the host of limbs (aṅgāvali);
  who is the Lord of the worlds and whose senses are the instruments of cognition;
  whose glory is that very Eye.

That which is the supreme leader of the host of mantras,
which is its own potency both within and without,
which bestows glory upon the knowers of yantras,
which protects the universe—
that radiance which is supreme, made of the highest nectar,
the Self of the universe, the fourth (turīya), the Trika,
the Eye composed of five, seven elements,
belonging to Śiva and Śakti—
we bow to that singular Hero, the Gracious One (Mṛḍa). || 1 ||

He who, abiding within the universe, in an instant makes it identical with His own Self by means of the sovereign goddesses of the wheels of energies (akṣacakreśvarī),
He who, being full, even outwardly shines forth in His own form as a throb of consciousness—
victorious is that Guru, unique and secret! || 2 ||

That splendour which is pure consciousness, which makes all appearances bloom,
which is self-luminous, autonomous, and vibrantly pulsing,
which consumes duality as its fuel,
and which surges forth with the nectar of supreme non-duality;
which removes the darkness of the gaze of duality and non-duality,
which is the single essence of the three splendours—
that Śaiva Eye shines forth here for the grace of the universe. || 3 ||

From my lotus-heart unfolded by the rays of the newly-risen sun of supreme knowledge,
may the nectar-like ones (the verses) delightfully perfume it
for the pacification of the cravings of this worthless Saṃsāra. || 4 ||

Here, with the desire to save all,
awakened by the Goddess of supreme consciousness,
wishing to deliver all beings,
by the grace of this very teaching that contains the secret of all āgamas,
having saluted the One worthy of salutation without salutation—
the introducer of the tantra…

# 2

He declares: the Possessor of Śakti, assuming threefold form in the three states,
by His own power performs the creation, maintenance, and dissolution of the entire universe. || 5 ||

To that Śiva, the Self composed of pure nectar,
to the Supreme Self who is beyond Brahma, Viṣṇu, and Īśa—
salutation! || 1-1 ||

# 3

To that Śiva, whose nature is the mass of consciousness and bliss, the form of ultimate beatitude,
to the Supreme Self—salutation!
I enter into Him with the attitude of complete surrender of self that is limited by body, Prāṇa, etc.

Of what kind?
Higher than Brahma, Viṣṇu, and Īśa,
beyond the finite ends that depend on Brahma and the rest,
the most excellent,
the agent of protection and reabsorption of this universe.

The word “Īśa” generally denotes Rudra, Īśvara, and Sadāśiva along with their dependents.
Because of its supremacy it is pure, untouched even by the great Māyā;
therefore it is composed of nectar, its very nature is the bliss of the universe;
“Ātmā” means its own intrinsic nature.
Precisely such will be described later in the supreme text of the Supreme Self.

# 4

“The true nature of the Supreme Self is devoid of all adjuncts.
Consciousness is declared in all scriptures to be the form of the Self.” (8-28)

# 5

Thus. To whom? He says “tridhā” etc.
He who is possessed of Śakti, autonomous,
by His own power, His autonomy-Śakti,
assuming threefold form—Brahma, Viṣṇu, Rudra—
in the three states whose forms are gross (bāhir), egg of Brahmā, Prakṛti, Māyā,
and subtle, consisting of heart etc., waking etc.,
because those states are manifested by Him alone—
creates, according to suitability, the arising, continuance, and dissolution of the entire universe up to Māyā.

Likewise, in the three states called dissolution, authority, and enjoyment,
assuming the threefold form of Anāśrita, Sadāśiva, Īśvara,
He creates simultaneously and appropriately the arising etc. of the entire universe in the pure path.
Dissolution and grace, being special forms of maintenance and reabsorption, are included therein;
thus He is the Lord who performs the five acts.
The subsequent text also corresponds to these two explanations:

# 6

“I, having three bodies, perform creation, maintenance, and dissolution.” (1-31)

# 7

It exists thus. Moreover, in the three supreme, intermediate, and inferior planes,
assuming the threefold form of action, knowledge, and will,
He creates arising etc. As He will say:

# 8

“Thus My will, called knowledge and action, is declared to be Śakti.” (1-29)

# 9

# 10

“By action-Śakti He creates, by knowledge-Śakti He maintains the universe,
and by Rudra-Śakti He performs dissolution.” (21-43)

# 11

Moreover, in the three supreme states whose nature is the measurable and the measurer,
because of the distinction of nara, Śakti, and Śiva,
assuming threefold form He creates the arising etc. of the entire universe.
As will be said:

“All mantras, by the method thus described, from the three realities…
become everywhere everything.” (21-57-58) etc.

Moreover, in the three states whose nature is utterance, oblation, and repose,
because of the distinction of letters, assuming threefold form with the visarga,
of the entire universe from Kālāgni upwards to the final part—
He who creates the upward arising etc. whose forms are existence, consciousness-fire, inner sacrificial bliss.
As He will declare:

# 12

“The Praṇava is the life of living beings.” (22-14)

# 13

up to “with the full” (22-17).

And another: in the three inner, left, right, and middle planes,
and outwardly in the states whose forms are evening, twilight etc.,
assuming threefold form whose circulation in the iḍā, piṅgalā, suṣumnā is special,
whose nature is moon, sun, fire—
He who creates the arising etc. whose forms are nourishment, illumination, burning of the entire universe.
As He will first show:

# 14

“Sun, moon, and fire—these three abodes are conceived.
The conception of three eyes is seen in Me for that purpose.

By burning and nourishing, by that I accomplish illumination.” (1-30-31)

# 15

In the sūtra the word “avasthā” is to be used in the sense of emotional state or locus according to context.
Having seen the correct reading thus, those who read “yas tridhā tisṛṣv avasthāsu” and “vidadhāti” and explain accordingly are laughable indeed. || 1-2 ||

Having thus saluted the chosen deity, the introducer of the tantra begins to speak of the manner of its descent:

# 16

Seated on the peak of Kailāsa, the Great Lord, God of gods,
sporting with His troops together with Pārvatī—Hara. || 2 ||

# 17

Seeing the joyful God, out of desire for the welfare of creatures,
quickly descending from His lap, Pārvatī grasped His feet. || 1-3 ||

# 18

She asked with supreme devotion, having pleased the Supreme Lord.

# 19

The Lord of gods called Maheśvara, the God of gods beginning with Brahma,
Hara—because He removes the darkness of all distinctions from illumination etc.,
because He grants enjoyment and liberation. As it is said:

# 20

“He who removes the bonds from the bound souls and elevates the soul—He is Hara.”

# 21

“Together with Pārvatī”—the husband of Umā, resident of Kailāsa, the Supreme Śiva;
thus, though sporting with external troops, in reality sporting with His own rays as troops—the creation of the universe etc. out of habitual delight;
therefore supremely joyful because of resting in His own wheel of rays, the mass of supreme bliss;
therefore, on whose head “ela” (the moon) shines, whose seat is the peak (śikhara) of that very high abode of the pervading and equal nature—
having seen (i.e. ascertained) Him seated there, whose essence is the expansion of the unmanā beyond unmanā,
the goddess, knowing the right moment, with humility, abandoning the host of rays that was her lap,
quickly, preceded by grasping the feet, with supreme devotion that worships His true nature,
having pleased Him, asked out of desire to save all as if they were her own children. || 1-4 ||

What she asked, He shows:

Śrī Devī said:

# 22

O Lord, God of gods, Lord of the world, Master of the universe! || 4 ||

That great wonder which You performed, causing astonishment
to the entire universe, O God—
yet for me, O Supreme Lord, || 1-5 ||

it is extremely difficult to comprehend, difficult to attain, a secret not revealed—
not to Kārtikeya, not to me, not to the gods or the gaṇas, || 1-6 ||

not to the Yogeśvarīs, the Mothers, the ṛṣis, or the yogins.
Therefore today, if You are pleased with me, O Lord of the world, || 1-7 ||

I, surrendered, pray: You should fully explain it.

# 23

O Lord, endowed with excellence of knowledge and lordship etc.,
Lord of the worshipful gods beginning with Brahma,
Lord of worlds, Master prayed to by worlds for the attainment of desired ends,
Master of the universe, the playful God,
Supreme Lord, embodiment of supreme Śiva—
thus the addresses, through the contemplation of both sakala and niṣkala forms,
are meant to manifest the Lord’s all-pervasiveness,
to make Him turn towards her out of intense devotion.

That great wonder which You performed,
which will be described later as the manifestation of The Eye that causes dissolution and reabsorption—
it caused astonishment not only to me but to the entire universe;
and it is difficult to know, to determine, to attain, to enter;
therefore it has not yet been revealed to anyone.
Yogeśvarīs are the external ones beginning with Khecarī;
Mothers are Brahma etc.;
ṛṣis are those of intense austerities;
yogins are worshippers of the Lord through six-limbed yoga etc.
“That” means the wonder.
“To me” means to one who enjoys Your devotion.
“You are pleased” means inner purity has arisen through the calming of the impurity of Māyā.
“Lord of the world” is not repetitive because it occurs in another sentence.
Since You are the Lord of the world, therefore I, surrendered, devoted solely to worshipping You, pray to You:
You should fully explain this to me, the surrendered one. || 8 ||

Here the introducer of the tantra makes the connection:

# 24

Having heard the words of the Goddess thus, with a smiling face He spoke. || 1-8 ||

# 25

“Prakṛṣṭa ḥāsa” is the great laughter, the absorption in the state of supreme nāda;
because it is said in the āmnāyas:
“From the unseen, peaceful Śiva who is the supreme cause,
the scripture emerged in the form of sound…”

Moreover, whose face is blooming because of the rise of the sattvic emotion of great laughter. || 9 ||

What did He say? He declares:

Śrī Bhagavān said:

# 26

What, what do you wish to say, O beautiful one?
The secret abiding in your heart—
I shall tell everything without doubt; I am pleased with you, O sinless one. || 1-9 ||

# 27

Because, knowing the right moment and being intensely inclined to save all, I am pleased with you;
therefore I shall tell you the entire secret without doubt.
“Speak what is in your heart”—by saying this He encourages the Goddess to ask specific questions.
Or, whatever secret it is, it abides only unopened in your heart.
In the reading “vadasi” the meaning is clear. || 1-10 ||

# 28

Thus, what the Lord promised in general to speak,
to make it firm—

# 29

Śrī Devī said:

# 30

O Lord, God of gods, performer of wondrous marvels!
I am hearing that marvellous, delightful wonder which I have never heard. || 10 ||

O All-pervading One, with pleased face, cause of supreme bliss,
without jealousy, O Lord, You should tell it to me. || 1-11 ||

# 31

“Of such kind”—that which abides in the heart and will be clarified;
“I have never heard”—whose reality has not yet been determined;
that I am hearing, I desire to know directly. || 1-12 ||

He clarifies this:

# 32

That Eye which, O God, is watery, is seen everywhere.
How then did the fierce fire that consumes time arise from it? || 12 ||

By merely seeing which the friend (Kāma) was reduced to ashes.
What fierce act did You perform, O God, with the desire to burn time and Kāma? || 1-13 ||

By which the entire universe, from Brahma to the immovable, was set ablaze.
Kāma too was burnt in sport by the Supreme Lord. || 1-14 ||

The fire of The Eye of wrath, O Lord, is not seen by anyone.
That which was done by the God of gods, causing great wonder. || 1-15 ||

O God, the fire in the interval of the eyes—apart from You, by whom is it seen?
Or if The Eye is made of fire, why is it not perceived? || 1-16 ||

By which Eye, coursing forth, O Master of the universe,
You instantly nourish the entire universe with pure nectar. || 1-17 ||

You delight me, O God, with that very pleased Eye
that is like nectar, pure white, causing the universe to be nourished. || 1-18 ||

From that which is like the fire of time, whence arises this fire?
All this, in brief, O Lord, You should explain. || 1-19 ||

# 33

Which Eye is seen as spherical by all—
that is watery because of the abundance of white form.

# 34

“O Goddess, my Eye-water…
flowed forth as Gaṅgā in ten ways.” (Svacchanda 10.174-175)

# 35

Because the Lord Himself has said thus in the glorious Svacchanda,
and although logicians infer it to be of the nature of light,
yet what is seen is watery for the reason stated;
therefore it is without heat; how then did the fire that consumes time arise—
a contradictory fire?
“What fierce act was performed”—did You, O illuminator of the universe,
with the desire to burn time, Kāma etc., raise this by Your autonomy?
Or was this wonder done by the God of gods, the illuminator of all circles of sense-powers,
since it is seen at the time of wrath by no one else, and therefore unseen by others?
Or, since it accords with the effect of burning time etc.,
and others accept it as such—
if The Eye is fiery, why is it not seen like a lamp that is the cause of the visibility of other things?
Let it not be so seen;
yet how with this fire do You, coursing forth, nourish the universe and delight me,
whose form is nectar?
Therefore, because of this, how can this which causes the arising of nectar
give rise to the fire that consumes time, Kāma etc., resembling the fire of universal dissolution?
Reconcile this apparent contradiction, O Supreme Lord. || 1-20 ||

Asked by the Goddess,

Śrī Bhagavān said:

# 36

Overcome by great curiosity, you ask this—listen, O beloved!

# 37

By saying “listen” He makes the Goddess attentive
and promises to determine the specific truth.

# 38

The fire that is in the interval of My eyes, and the supreme nectar— || 20 ||

I shall explain all that by the method of yoga—listen, O beloved!

# 39

The dual fire-and-nectar in My eyes, which is supreme secret as previously stated—
it burns the bonds, time etc.,
and nourishes the universe by entering the supreme abode;
I shall explain it by the method of yoga, by entering the expansion of the supreme non-dual—
and you listen and reflect inwardly in the same way.
This is the opening statement.
Here the secret of The Eye whose nature is supreme fire-and-nectar is the subject to be taught.
By the qualification “supreme” its character as the means to both enjoyment and liberation is indicated.
The sixfold connection from supreme to divine is well-known. || 1-21 ||

# 40

Because it is to be taught as the reality of The Eye,
the name 'Eye' has been declared.

# 41

To clarify:

# 42

Whose own intrinsic form is pure, all-pervading, facing all directions, || 21 ||

abiding in the interior of all beings, the life of all creatures,
attainable by yoga, difficult of access, unattainable by those whose self is unperfected, || 1-22 ||

My own potency, known only to Myself, My supreme abode alone,
that potency is the potency of all potencies, that is the strength of the strong, || 1-23 ||

that is the lustre of all that possess lustre—eternal, unmoving, firm.
That is My supreme will-Śakti, united with Śakti, born of My own nature, || 1-24 ||

to be known like the heat of fire, like the rays of the sun;
or it is My own Śakti, the cause of the entire universe. || 1-25 ||

# 43

Therein reside the qualities beginning with omniscience, manifest and unmanifest.

# 44

It is that very will that becomes knowledge and is expanded with the qualities beginning with action. || 1-26 ||

Those six qualities beginning with knowledge that were previously mentioned—
they abide there and come forth.
It is that very one which, as great action, is considered the single action. || 1-27 ||

It produces and withdraws the eight qualities beginning with aṇimā.
Thus My Śakti is called will, knowledge, and action. || 1-28 ||

Sun, moon, fire—the conception of three abodes;
the conception of three eyes is seen in Me for that purpose. || 1-29 ||

# 45

By burning and nourishing, by that I accomplish illumination.

Whose own intrinsic form, without specific adjuncts,
is the Self of the universe whose forms are object, means of knowledge, and knower,
the cause of the establishment of everything—
pure by its very nature, all-pervading, not covered by the universe though manifesting the universe on its own ground like a mirror,
whose faces are powers coursing in all directions,
and all cognitions of blue, pleasure etc.

# 46

“The Śaiva mouths are declared here” (Vijñānabhairava 20)

# 47

by this situation the means of attainment are the faces;
abiding in the interior of all beings from immovable to Brahma as the I-sense in every form,
the life in all creatures in whom vital energy etc. are manifest—
“First consciousness is transformed into Prāṇa”—
by this situation it has taken the plane of Prāṇa etc.;
therefore attainable by yoga, by the calming of the knowership of Prāṇa etc.,
difficult of access—

# 48

“This is attained by one whose Lord is not pleased”

# 49

by this rule attainable only with the descent of Śakti and by instruction,
and attained with difficulty—

# 50

“Even if somehow attained, craving is not produced”

# 51

by this situation only by some in later births who are intensely devoted,
not by those of unsteady mind—
My own potency that is the power of reflective awareness, the strength that creates the universe.
As in the glorious Kālīkula:

# 52

“Of that God of gods whose nature is supreme knowledge,
reflective awareness is the supreme Śakti, omniscient, possessing knowledge.”

# 53

Known only to itself, self-luminous, “Mine alone”—of the husband of Umā, the supreme abode alone.
The “va” is in reverse order.
It is the potency even of the countless wondrous mantras, mudrās etc.
It is the very strength of the strong winds etc.
It is the very lustre of all that possess lustre.
As was said:

# 54

“Acting without regard to possible and impossible through the touch of supreme mastery—
that is declared by the wise as brilliance, luminous with consciousness.”

# 55

And all that is eternal, unchanging, unmoving, without transformation, firm, perpetual, possessing the universe as its form.
“That” which is thus My supreme will-Śakti connected with Me, having attained the state of will.
What kind of will? Born of its own nature, innate, united with Śakti—i.e. embracing non-difference with all the powers of the universe.
As said in the glorious former (Mālinīvijaya):

# 56

“That Śakti of the doer of the universe which is called concomitant—
that Goddess, when there is desire to create, assumes the state of will.” (Mā.Vi. 3-5)

# 57

etc. He clarifies “born of its own nature” by “like the heat of fire, like the rays of the sun”,
and explains “united with Śakti”.
By “of the entire universe” its own Śakti belonging to the nature of consciousness-bliss, the cause of the entire universe, not separate.
The qualities beginning with omniscience that are there are manifest and unmanifest—i.e. in contracted form.
“That very will”—will-Śakti alone

# 58

“It is thus and not otherwise—this is definitively known.
Making known in the universe here, it is called knowledge-Śakti.” (Mā.Vi. 3-7)

# 59

by the method stated in the glorious former, having made it knowledge-Śakti

# 60

“When again it becomes ‘let this thing be thus’,
then making it so, it is called action here.” (Mā.Vi. 3-8)

# 61

by this situation it has become action-Śakti.
Of what kind? Expanded with qualities—i.e. attained extension through all effects that are its attributes.
Those six qualities beginning with knowledge previously stated as contracted in will—
they abide in action-Śakti, become fully manifest in the station of Lord Bhaṭṭāraka, come forth, expand.
“Hi” because thus, therefore what was said earlier “manifest and unmanifest” is correct.
“That very one as great action”—action-Śakti whose nature is Lord Bhaṭṭāraka, that very one is considered the single action, the cause of the Lord in the creation of the universe.
And that very one produces and withdraws the eight qualities beginning with aṇimā.
By the method thus stated My Śakti, whose nature is autonomy, is called the triad of will etc.
Sun etc.—the triad of will etc. Śaktis are conceived as fire, sun, moon in the middle, right, and left paths,
and outwardly and inwardly the sun etc. are nothing but the expansion of will etc. Śaktis.
As said in the glorious Svacchanda:

# 62

"This knowledge-Śakti of the Lord shines with the form of the sun...
...action-Śakti shines in the form of the moon..." (Sv. 10.498-502)

# 63

etc. “Three eyes”—for the manifestation of My form the conception of three eyes, the opening of three eyes, is seen.
And that too for that purpose—for the manifestation of the triad of Śaktis presiding over the three established abodes.
As said even in the Bhārata:

# 64

"When the three goddesses constantly attend Him,
then He is to be known as Tryambaka [three-eyed one]..."

# 65

“By burning etc.”—since thus the supreme abode alone is Eye by the method stated,
therefore whatever I do—burning of time and Kāma, nourishing the universe, illumination etc.—is proper;
what is impossible for the abode of all powers, consciousness? That is the meaning.

Therefore:

# 66

“And having three bodies I perform creation, maintenance, and dissolution.” || 1-30 ||

# 67

Whose three bodies are Brahma, Viṣṇu, Rudra—
I alone, consisting of consciousness, perform creation etc. in order.
Or, having assumed the forms of Anāśrita, Sadāśiva, Īśvara,
in the pure path I perform creation etc.,
and dissolution and grace which are included in maintenance and reabsorption—
thus I alone perform the five acts; there are no others separate from Me.
Those who, abandoning such clear literal meaning,
say that the Lord performs creation etc. through the agency of Brahma etc.,
are simply deluded. || 1-31 ||

Moreover:

# 68

All this is filled by that potency of Mine, augmented by My splendour.
The nectar of The Eye consisting of will, knowledge, action—supreme. || 1-31 ||

# 69

Filled by that potency whose nature is autonomy-Śakti previously described,
augmented by My splendour that is consciousness-light, all-pervading, causing nourishment etc.—
the triad of will etc. Śaktis in harmony,
which will be described as having the characteristics of the protector of The Eye etc.,
nectar because of the imperishability and nature of supreme bliss,
supreme because there is no other higher than it—thus it is called anuttama. || 32 ||

Moreover:

# 70

That potency is the supreme abode which is of the nature of supreme nectar.
That which is supreme bliss, which is this supreme station— || 1-32 ||

That alone, partless, pure knowledge, the supreme Eye.

# 71

That potency previously described whose nature is autonomy-Śakti,
because it causes the sun etc. to shine, is the supreme abode,
of the nature of supreme nectar because of imperishability through being consciousness-form.
“That which”—Brahma whose nature is supreme bliss.
“Which this”—always self-luminous,
the supreme station because it is the foundation of all the universe external and internal.
“That this”—by the word “that” the contemplated object previously mentioned,
as if now clarified, which was contemplated everywhere,
with the word “this” together with the word “that” indicates recognition whose object is the reality of the Self.
Partless, beyond the parts of sakala and niṣkala,
because the parts have departed—thus pure, supreme non-dual,
that knowledge, consciousness, is called The Eye—
not the watery one suspected in the question,
nor the ever-inferred one of fiery nature like The Eye of Govinda. || 1-33 ||

Since this is so:

# 72

It is proclaimed by the Conqueror of death, bestowing liberation on all. || 33 ||

That which grants siddhi, the supreme God, delivering from all suffering.

# 73

“Ca” for emphasis. “By that”—by the form of partless consciousness,
proclaimed by the Conqueror of death—this outlining of the future manner of conquering death.
Bestowing liberation on all—by this the authorities for daily rites, initiation, consecration are implied.
And He will say:

# 74

"All beings from brahmins onward, all afflicted by faults and fears,
are liberated merely by remembering Him..."  (Netra 2-16)


# 75

By “all” and through the future pervasion of the supreme non-dual,
the plane of liberation is equal for worshippers of whatever deity is famous in whatever tradition—Viṣṇu, Sugata etc. is implied.
“That which grants siddhi”—implication of the future chapter on siddhi.
“Supreme God”—the inclusion of immersion in the reality of the illuminating principles etc.
As He will say:

# 76

“If it is perceived merely by closing and opening the eyes,
from then on he is liberated, he does not take birth again.” (Netra 8-9)

# 77

Therefore, for those who have entered the supreme reality,
delivering from all future suffering without the knowership of body etc. || 34 ||

# 78

The God that removes all diseases, that removes all afflictions, auspicious, || 1-34 ||

removing poverty eternally, Conqueror of death, facing all directions.

# 79

It removes all various internal and external diseases—fevers etc.—
by the manifold forms of mantras, yantras etc. that will be described in the fifteenth and sixteenth chapters,
therefore auspicious, whose nature is beatitude.
“Removing poverty”—the ritual of glorious Mahālakṣmī etc. that will be described in the eighteenth chapter is implied.
“Eternally Conqueror of death”—by this the eighth chapter is indicated, the supreme manner of conquering death.
“And facing all directions as Conqueror of death”—by this the manner of conquering death through subtle meditation described in the seventh chapter,
and also the manners through meditation, homa etc. are indicated.
As He will say:

# 80

“When attacked by diseases or overtaken by untimely death,
then it should be worshipped with white offerings or with milk and ghee,

or with sesame, milk, and fuel sticks—by homa one obtains peace.” (6-37-38)

# 81

etc. || 1-35 ||

Moreover:

# 82

Infallible, stainless, peaceful, bestowing all, liberating all, || 35 ||

whose lustre equals thousands of millions of suns
and thousands of ten thousands of fires—
not even the sixteenth part does it deserve. || 1-36 ||

Because it is composed of all splendour, therefore unassailable by gods and demons.
By that fire of The Eye I certainly burn everything in an instant. || 1-37 ||

By that very one again I accomplish nourishment and illumination.

# 83

Infallible because of culminating in the final fruit that is supreme bliss.
Stainless because always shining in all states.
Peaceful because of the calming of duality, consisting of consciousness alone;
yet bestowing all because, though creator of the universe etc., solely intent on grace;
liberating all—grants all life, strength etc.
As He will say:

# 84

“Life, strength, fame, affection, steadfastness, wisdom, vitality, wealth—
all proceed from Him; the highest kingdom for kings.” (Netra 6.46)

# 85

etc. Whatever is imagined as equal to the splendour of countless suns, fires etc.
—that too only because it is imagined.
“Of that”—of the present great abode,
it does not deserve even the sixteenth part, not similar even to the subtlest part—
because it is the form of the supreme knower without imagination.
Unassailable, not to be overcome.
“I burn everything”—at the great dissolution, not to speak of time and Kāma—certainly.
“And by that very one again nourishment and illumination”—at the end of the kalpa I do everything;
not to speak of nourishing depleted elements, animals, obstructed eyes, etc.
By this the future creation etc. in the twenty-first chapter is implied. || 1-38 ||

Moreover:

# 86

Therefore no other potency whatever is seen higher than that. || 38 ||

That alone is the weapon, fierce, the supreme ferry for limited souls.

# 87

This alone is the supreme potency.
As He will say:

# 88

“Countless millions of mantras, manifest and unmanifest, are established—
all those grant siddhi; they are concealed by the initial and final tuṭi.” (Netra 14-9)

# 89

By this the supremacy over all mantras in the fourteenth and twenty-second chapters is indicated.
Therefore fierce, cutting distinction, consisting of the sword of knowledge,
the supreme ferry for limited souls. || 1-39 ||

Likewise:

# 90

It is declared to be the weapon that destroys all enemies. || 39 ||

It bestows life on all beings—that is its weapon.

Because it causes the destruction of all enemies—weapon, since “śas” means to injure.

# 91

As He will say:

# 92

“Bringing victory to kings terrified by enemy kingdoms.” (Netra 17-6)

# 93

“Of all”—even of the fourteen immovable beings etc.,
it bestows life, vital energies—because it is the single form of pure autonomous consciousness.
And that weapon, because nothing specific is mentioned, is everything because of being great potency. || 1-40 ||

He says that:

# 94

That one potency spread forth in infinite distinctions. || 40 ||

# 95

Spread forth with infinite distinctions, with manifold variety. || 1-41 ||

He clarifies this very point:

# 96

The great Pāśupata for Me, Sudarśana for Viṣṇu,
the Brahma-daṇḍa for Brahma—everyone’s own weapon. || 41 ||

# 97

“For Me”—for My sake; the rest is clear. || 1-42 ||

And this:

# 98

In manifold forms as weapons, manifold thus.
The weapons of the gods in their own forms were bestowed by Me as My potency. || 42 ||

# 99

Whatever weapons the gods have in manifold forms together with their own natures—
those I bestowed as My own potency, i.e. manifested with such variety. || 1-43 ||

Objection: “Śiva is one, unchanging; His Śakti too is not different from Him.
They cannot be manifold; or consciousness without action would be transformed.”
—this is suggested by the dualists. How can this be said?

# 100

But by the power of yoga, O Lord of yoga, by that this universe is pervaded.

# 101

"Yoga is His own powers which flash forth in all directions."
by the method stated in the āmnāya,
the power of yoga, of the powers beginning with the left etc.—
by that power the universe is pervaded, i.e. threaded and interwoven in every part with identity with it.
As said in the Śiva-sūtras:

# 102

“The surge of His Śaktis is the universe.” (Śiva-sūtra 3-30)

# 103

Moreover:

# 104

It is the supreme protection for the frightened, the highest fearlessness for the terrified. || 43 ||

# 105

And for those afflicted by enemies, the certain supreme liberation.

“For the frightened”—the supreme protection for those sealed by various shadow-defects, planet-spirits, Yakṣas, Śākinīs etc. that will be described in the nineteenth chapter—
the supreme unsealing that will be described in that chapter.
And the highest fearlessness for the terrified.
As He will say:

# 106

“It protects all, it ferries the terrified.” (22-11)

# 107

Terror is intense fear that shakes the heart.
And the highest fearlessness for those afflicted by enemies.
As He will say concerning the king of mantras dedicated to glorious Mahālakṣmī:

# 108

“To be meditated upon at the time of battle, seated on sword, petal, creeper—
it certainly grants victory, removes the pride of enemies.” (18-86)

# 109

Certainly, the supreme liberation—this is its principal nature.

He concludes:

# 110

Why speak at length with repetition, O beautiful one? || 1-44 ||

Whatever is extremely fierce, or glorious and mighty,
grace, bestowal of boons, beatitude, illumination—that very one. || 1-45 ||

That is to be known, immeasurable, the knowledge that is the great strength of mantras,
protector of all beings—always to be concealed by you. || 1-46 ||

Today it has been told to you, O Goddess—what more do you ask?

# 111

Extremely fierce—accomplishes even the impossible instantly;
fierce—the destroyer; glorious—great glory;
mighty—extraordinary strength;
grace—extremely pure;
bestowing boons—granting whatever is desired;
beatitude—the essence of resting in one’s own Self with all afflictions calmed;
illumination itself—the form of light as sun, moon, fire etc.
Whatever exists in the six paths—that very one—
by this, whose nature is the previously described mass of illuminating bliss,
the all-excelling, all-pervading nature of the Lord of the Eye is declared.
“Hi” because thus, therefore the connection is “why speak at length?”
By this manifestation of all-pervasiveness the reality of all practices that will be shown in the sixteenth chapter is implied.
And that reality, because supreme over the universe, is to be known;
and because all-pervading, capable of being known;
and worthy.
Yet immeasurable knowledge, the form of unbounded consciousness, not the object of any means of knowledge.
As said in the Trika-hṛdaya:

# 112

"Just as a dog's footprint attempts to leap over its own head's shadow—
the head cannot be where the feet are; so is this bindu digit."

# 113

And in the Pratyabhijñā:

# 114

“Of Him who is wondrous with the wonder of the universe…” (2-3-15)

# 115

The great strength of millions of mantras, the supreme potency.
This too will be implied in the fourteenth, twenty-first, and twenty-second chapters.
And this, by protecting all beings with manifold grace, is the ferry—
“tra” protects, therefore “tāra” (ferry, shining).
Therefore this is the supreme secret, to be concealed.
Therefore to be protected, to be revealed only to those who have received the descent of Śakti.
And it has been told to you who are fit, at the time of intense desire to know the supreme reality through extremely intense descent of Śakti.
“What more do you ask?”—to give scope for future topics, for the connection with the next section. Thus auspicious.

# 116

Possessing perfect harmony with the all-pervasiveness of the entire universe, beautiful,
the glorious mass of consciousness and bliss—
we worship the auspicious Eye.

# 117

Thus, on the Śrī Netra Tantra,  
in the *Netrodyota* composed by the venerable Kṣemarāja,  
who is supreme among the great Ācāryas devoted to Maheśvara,  
this concludes the first chapter:
**Exposition of the Unity of the Real Nature**
