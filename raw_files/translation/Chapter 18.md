Eighteenth Chapter
Neṭrodyotaḥ: The Illumination of the Eye

That which the God of gods has not revealed—how practitioners (sādhakas) attain siddhi (perfection/power). ||18-2||  
Those spells employed by others (hostile forces) perish—kṛtyā, khārkhoda, udaka, and so on.  
“Uktetyādiḥ” is a reiteration of what was stated earlier. “Sūcitam” means the piercing (kīlana), splitting (bhedana), and bewildering (mohana) of mantras (quoted from 16-33 in the sixteenth chapter).  
“By the God of gods” means by You Yourself. “Yathā” means by the method through which, by the application of piercing etc., practitioners attain success, and by which kṛtyā, khārkhoda, udaka etc. employed by others are destroyed.  
Kṛtyā is a vetālī that has entered a woman’s corpse for the destruction of an enemy; khārkhoda is a yantra that causes death, uprooting, etc.; the word “ādi” includes images fashioned for the same purpose. The connection is: “Reveal this matter (to me).”  

Furthermore:  
# 2  
By the Pratyaṅgirā procedure He slays innumerable malignant beings. ||18-3||  
O Mahādeva, tell me that method plainly, without any doubt.  

# 3  
The vidyā that turns back (pratīpam) upon the petty practitioner and makes him experience the very fruit of his petty rites is called Pratyaṅgirā (the Counter-striking One); it is a distinct term. “Prayogeṇa” means “by the application.”  

To resolve this, the blessed Lord said:  
# 4  
Among all disputations (vāda), mantra-vāda is here the highest. ||18-4||  
Knowing this, the mantrī should employ the limbs of the mantra, O fair one.  

# 5  
Among all the vādas—dhātu-vāda, khani-vāda, etc.—that have mantra as their primary object of contemplation, the highest is mantra-vāda. By means of those (limbs) the mantras are “limbed” (ling-yante) and adorned (citrī-kriyante). Having learnt those limbs which produce illumination etc. from scripture, the mantrī who knows the essence of tantra should employ them at the proper time.  

He indicates them:  
# 6  
Illumination (dīpana), awakening (bodhana), striking (Tāḍana), consecration (abhiṣecana), ||18-5||  
purification (vimalīkaraṇa), and likewise the insertion of fuel (indhana-niveśana),  
satiation (tarpaṇa), concealment (gupti-bhāva), and expansion (Āpyāyana) as the ninth. ||18-6||  
Thus in nine ways the complete mantra-vāda is known.  
He who knows it knows the means of accomplishing mantra-accomplishment. ||18-7||  

# 7  
Illumination of a mantra is done with the Praṇava (Oṃ). Awakening with the word namaḥ. Striking with the phat-kāra. Consecration with the vauṣaṭ-kāra. Purification with the svāhā. Insertion of fuel—i.e. the burning of obstructive bonds, poison, etc.—is done by enveloping (sampuṭīkaraṇa) with the huṃ-kāra. As it is said in the revered Ucchuṣma Tantra:  
# 8  
“In illumination, O great fortunate one, the Praṇava is placed at both ends.  
In awakening, the namaskāra; in purification, the svāhā-kāra.  
The mantra ending in vauṣaṭ should be employed in consecration.  
The mantra enveloped on both sides by phat should be employed in striking.  
The huṃ-kāra at beginning and end should be employed in fuel-insertion.”  

# 9  
Tarpaṇa is powerful satiation, done by enveloping each syllable with the lāṃ-kāra.  
As it is said:  
# 10  
“By the seed lāṃ-kāra, and also when placed alternately,  
the mantra becomes powerful…”  

# 11  
Thus. Gupti-bhāva is protection, which arises from ten thousand japa-s of the mantra enveloped by Amṛteśa (the Netra mantra with Amṛta). As it is said:  
# 12  
“Having enveloped it with Amṛteśa (the conqueror of death), one should again japa ten thousand times.  
By japa performed in this way, protection of the mantra is accomplished.”  

# 13  
Thus. Āpyāyana is the nourishing of a mantra that has regained strength, done by enveloping each syllable with the vāṃ-kāra.  
As it is said:  
# 14  
“By the vāṃ-kāra placed alternately, always,  
the mantra becomes expanded…”  

# 15  
Thus. He who knows mantra-vāda in these nine ways knows that the mantras themselves are the means and the causes of siddhi, and he knows how to bring their accomplishment under his own control. ||18-8||  

Furthermore:  
# 16  
The mantra is again elevenfold and must be known, O beloved.  
By its correct employment lords of sādhakas attain siddhi. ||18-8||  

# 17  
By that elevenfold knowledge, by correct application of the mantra in action, lords of sādhakas attain siddhi and obtain what they desire. ||18-9||  

Since this is so:  
# 18  
I shall now fully declare that (elevenfold method) which is accepted in all scriptures.  

# 19  
Therein:  
# 20  
Sampuṭa, grathita, grasta, samasta, vidarbhita, ||18-9||  
ākrānta, ādyanta, garbhastha, sarvato-vṛta,  
and likewise yuktividarba and vidarbha-grathita. ||18-10||  

# 21  
Thus mantras employed in eleven ways are remembered as bestowers of siddhi.  

# 22  
Placement of the mantra at the beginning and end is saṃpuṭa.  

# 23  
As it is said:  
# 24  
“The wise one should first write the mantra, then the name of the object,  
thereafter again write the mantra: this is proclaimed as saṃpuṭa.”  

# 25  
Enveloping the mantra syllable by syllable is grathita. As it is said: “Each syllable of the object enveloped by the syllables of the mantra…”  
# 26  
Grathita…  

# 27  
Thus. Placement of the mantra in the four directions around the central name is grasta.  
As it is said:  
# 28  
“The wise one should place the mantra above, below, and across;  
the name in the centre: this is called grasta.”  

# 29  
After the mantra, the name, and again the same: this is the characteristic of samasta.  
As it is said:  
# 30  
“First place the mantra, then the object;  
thus joining it twice: samasta…”  

# 31  
Thus. After the name, the mantra once: this is vidarbhita.  
As it is said:  
# 32  
“First the object, then the mantra once:  
vidarbhita…”  

# 33  
Thus. If the mantra surrounds the central name by encircling: ākrānta.  
As it is said:  
# 34  
“Having overpowered the object with the mantra, encircle it on all sides:  
ākrānta…”  

# 35  
Thus. After the mantra, the name, then the mantra thrice: ādyanta.  
As it is said:  
# 36  
“At the end place the mantra thrice, at the beginning once;  
the name in the middle: ādyanta…”  

# 37  
Thus. Placement of the target-name in the four directions around the central mantra: garbhastha.  
As it is said:  
# 38  
“What was said as the mark of grasta is also said for garbhastha.”  

# 39  
Thus. Placement of the target-name at the beginning and end of the mantra: sarvato-vṛta.  
As it is said:  
# 40  
“The form that exists in saṃpuṭa exists also in sarvato-vṛta.”  

# 41  
Thus. After the mantra, the object placed three times with enveloping: yuktividarba.  
As it is said:  
# 42  
“At the beginning of the mantra the object threefold with enveloping:  
yuktividarba…”  

# 43  
Thus. After the name, the mantra thrice: vidarbha-grathita.  
As it is said:  
# 44  
“First the object, then the mantra written thrice:  
vidarbha-grathita…”  

# 45  
Thus. Employed by practitioners.  

Furthermore:  
# 46  
Siddha, sādhya, susiddha, and likewise ari (hostile)—||18-11||  
knowing all these fully, one should perform the nyāsa of the mantra.  

# 47  
Dividing the letters of the mantra beginning with Praṇava—starting from a-kāra, u-kāra, ma-kāra, etc., with their measures—and placing below them the letters of the practitioner’s own name, then counting in the order of the mātṛkā up to the letter of the mantra that falls above the practitioner’s name-letter, the positions first, second, third, and fourth are declared to be siddha etc. respectively. As it is said in the revered Svacchanda:  
# 48  
“Having separated the mantra-letter together with measure and bindu,  
one should place one’s own name-letter in the lower part.  
Beginning from one’s own letter up to the mantra-letter that arrives—  
whichever it falls upon, O Goddess, consider that as the result.  
I briefly explain that which moves along the lines and fingers:  
in the first joint: siddha; in the second: sādhya;  
in the third: susiddha; in the fourth joint the hostile is to be known.  
Abandoning hostile and sādhya, one should give it with the kiss (cumbaka).  
Siddha and susiddha bestow enjoyment and liberation.” (Svacch. 8.20-24)  

# 49  
Thus.  

Furthermore:  
# 50  
Rising and setting, pervasion, meditation, and mudrā in their true form—||18-12||  
he who knows them thus is omniscient, accomplishes everything, the supreme practitioner.  

# 51  
Rising and setting: the expansion and repose in the heart and the Dvādaśānta. Pervasion: the virile energy of mantras. Meditation: upon the mantra. Mudrā: the one appropriate to it. “In their true form” means in the form of virility.  

# 52  
Thus with all the remaining varieties of feeling, O Sovereign of the gods, ||18-13||  
the great mantras should be contemplated; they become bestowers of fruit, O beloved.  

# 53  
“With the remaining” means purity of part, external and internal purification of parts, the rising of parts, etc. Varieties of feeling: meditations etc. according to the respective deities.  

Since this is so:  
# 54  
Therefore with all effort, having understood everything, one should employ it. ||18-14||  

# 55  
Lest someone think that here, unlike with other mantras, some fanciful procedure applies to this king of mantras, He says:  
# 56  
For this king of mantras there is no consideration of division.  

# 57  
Because this one  
# 58  
is the encompasser of all kings of mantras, the supreme Lord. ||18-15||  

# 59  
For, in the manner previously described:  
# 60  
Mantras bound by this are like gems on a thread.  

# 61  
Likewise:  
# 62  
Mantras placed within its womb are born bestowing liberation and siddhi. ||18-16||  

# 63  
That this is fitting, He says:  
# 64  
The supreme, all-pervading God who causes the arising of the fruit of all siddhis,  
all-auspicious pervader, facing all directions, imperishable, ||18-17||  
the fulfiller of all mantras, the protector with all-powerful strength,  
the source of mantras, bestowing liberation and siddhi—Śiva. ||18-18||  
Therefore, O Goddess, for this mantra there is no consideration.  

# 65  
This has been explained in previous commentaries.  

Because by the aforesaid method there exists injury from ignorance of the virility of parts such as the capacity to accomplish the target, purification of parts, etc.—striking, swallowing, etc.—and because malignant mantra-practitioners cause striking, swallowing, etc. of people by means of mantra, yantra, and the like, therefore:  
# 66  
If a practitioner is perforated by these thousands of defects, ||18-19||  
swallowed by Vināyakas, afflicted by diseases and disorders,  
whose citizens are indifferent, whose servants are disloyal, without sons, in great misery, ||18-20||  
whose sons and wives are dead, fearful, deprived of splendour,  
whose ācāryas or practitioners turn their faces away from mantra-siddhi, ||18-21||  
whose women are sonless, ill-fated, barren, hated by their husbands—  
united with thousands of such painful defects, ||18-22||  

# 67  
whosoever they may be—  
# 68  
having seen those men in the world polluted by the aforesaid defects,  
for them one should perform the sacrifice that brings fortune, the supreme one. ||18-23||  
The Śrī-Yāga, O Supreme Sovereign, with this mantra by the mantrī.  

# 69  
The form of which will be described immediately. For when this is performed:  
# 70  
When the great Lakṣmī-Yāga is done, a man becomes possessor of fortune, ||18-24||  
freed from the defects mentioned earlier, he obtains supreme happiness.  

# 71  
And in that Yāga:  
# 72  
He who is consecrated with the kalaśa, having worshipped great Śrī, ||18-25||  
obtains desires unimaginable, equal to Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Śiva.  

# 73  
“Having worshipped and been consecrated by the ācārya”—connection. “Kāmyante” means desires—special states of mantra, mantra-lord, etc.  

Since this is so:  
# 74  
Thus knowing, the wise one should perform a most beautiful Yāga. ||18-26||  

# 75  
This one that brings fortune. ||18-27||  

Because:  
# 76  
This Yāga, O Goddess, is in every way the supreme bestower of all excellence.  

# 77  
Therein:  
# 78  
In the aforesaid ground that possesses all characteristics, ||18-27||  
free from all thorns, delightful, or in a great lotus-forest,  
well-concealed, excellent, well-hidden, upon a shrine—||18-28||  
one should draw a square maṇḍala all around.  
(One should drop nineteen threads in the east-west direction.) ||18-29||  

# 79  
The word “ti” is elided here. “In the east-west” means running east-west. ||18-30||  
# 80  
Likewise the southern and northern threads should be perfectly equal.  

# 81  
“Likewise” means one should drop exactly nineteen.  

When this is done:  
# 82  
There with eighteen parts in the four directions all around, ||18-30||  
the cells become three hundred and twenty-four.  

# 83  
With eighteen multiplied by eighteen the count is thus.  

Then:  
# 84  
In its centre one should draw a beautiful eight-petalled lotus—||18-31||  
in the eighth part…  

# 85  
Meaning: leaving five parts all around.  

How? He says:  
# 86  
…its centre should then be divided four ways.  

# 87  
“That” means the eighth part.  

Therein:  
# 88  
In the first: the pericarp should be made; in the second: the filaments; ||18-32||  
in the third: the petal-joints; in the fourth: the petal-tips.  

# 89  
“In the first” means in the part. The joints are the petals.  

And those parts:  
# 90  
One should revolve four circles, perfectly equal in measure. ||18-33||  

# 91  
Perfect equality of the circles with respect to themselves; equal measure with respect to each other. ||18-34||  

Then:  
# 92  
One should drop eight threads in the directions and likewise in the intermediate directions.  
Taking the eastern direction, according to the measure of the central thread—||18-34||  

# 93  
The petal should be placed at the filament…  
Striking eight threads between the eight threads, following the central thread, taking the eastern direction, in order to produce connected petals in the future, dividing the two side-threads from the middle, one should make the petal extending to the two future side-threads from the two revolving circles. Of what kind? Placed at the filaments, meaning endowed with three filaments.  
In the same way, constructing the remaining petals by the method of extension:  
# 94  
…in its centre one should draw the pericarp.  

# 95  
He explains the technique for revolving the two sides:  
# 96  
Placing the thread at the petal-joint, one should revolve it on the sides. ||18-35||  

# 97  
Making the left hand with thread enter the interval of the central side-threads, making that very thread reach the petal-joint, “on the sides” means revolve with the right hand on both sides.  

When the thread has thus been revolved:  
# 98  
With both sides one should complete the previous petal.  

# 99  
“With both” means limited.  

He extends this:  
# 100  
The pericarp should be yellow; the filaments are remembered as green; ||18-36||  
the stamens multicoloured, twenty-four in number.  
White, red, and yellow from root, middle, and tip; ||18-37||  
the petals should be pure white; the sky-line circular.  
Of the outer one, by thumb-measure, white in colour, very beautiful. ||18-38||  
The intervening petals red…  

# 101  
Filaments are seeds. The stamens should be white at the root, red in the middle, yellow at the tip. “Petals” means including their tips. “Of the outer” means of the lotus. By saying “intervening petals” he teaches that the lotus should be made without joined petals, by division of side-lines up to the sky-line.  

# 102  
…outside it a square.  

# 103  
Should be made.  

For that purpose:  
# 104  
Likewise with finger-measure, a white line, but yellow… ||18-39||  

# 105  
should be given; at the end, in the outer part, yellow joined with orpiment etc. ||18-40||  

Furthermore:  
# 106  
Then outside it the limbs in two parts on each side.

# 107  
“On each side in two parts” means the two parts on the sides; that means four parts in each direction. The limbs are special parts going between the corners, outside the sky-line.  

He explains the depositing of powder on the pedestal:  
# 108  
By difference of colour—white etc.—beginning from the south-east corner, ||18-40||  
one should draw the limbs yellow, beginning from the east etc.  

# 109  
With respect to the direction facing the deity, in the order beginning from south-east up to north-east, one should deposit powder in the corners with the distinction white, red, yellow, black. In the intervals between corners, the limbs of the four directions should be drawn yellow.  

Also outside that:  
# 110  
Then two parts each should be omitted all around for the pathway. ||18-41||  

# 111  
“All around” means in all directions. The pathway is the road for worship. ||18-42||  

# 112  
It should be drawn with black powder adorned with lotus and conch.  

# 113  
Lotus and conch are the marks of Śrī.  

Likewise outside that:  
# 114  
One should make the gate white with two parts on each side. ||18-42||  

# 115  
“On each side” means in the remaining two-part measure on each side. Thus for the lotus, outside the eight cells, five cells on each side for the pedestal and two for the pathway having been stated, the gate is stated in the remaining two cells. And the mention here of eighteen cells is to reveal that the Yāga pervades the eighteenfold path of tattvas that are to be purified, contracted here into the garbhīkṛta state. ||18-43||  

Furthermore for it:  
# 116  
With the measure of the pathway in breadth, with half the pathway one should make  
the neck…

# 117  
“On the side” is carried over. With respect to the central thread, “on the side” means on each side. With the measure of the pathway, meaning with two parts; in totality however with four parts as breadth-measure, and likewise with one part as half the pathway, impliedly above, one should employ to make the neck, the special upper part of the gate for passage.  

# 118  
…and likewise the sub-neck…  

# 119  
The special lower part of the neck; “likewise” means with respect to the neck, two parts on each side, in totality with eight parts as breadth-measure, and with one part from the upper measure one should make.  

With the gates turned outward in the two sides of the gate:  
# 120  
…likewise the beautiful and the less beautiful. ||18-43||  

# 121  
One should make. ||18-44||  

Having thus completed the gates, one should make three circles.  
# 122  
The western one should be made open…  

# 123  
“Western” means the one in the western direction, facing the deity.  

To describe the position and colour of śobhā and upaśobhā:  
# 124  
…one should draw on the two sides ||18-44||  
the beautiful and the less beautiful, red and yellow.  
In the four directions at each gate with upper and lower cells. ||18-45||  

# 125  
“With cells” means with those that produce the turned-gate arrangement. Although the number of cells is not stated here, nevertheless the division arises as one below, five above, etc. ||18-46||  

Then in the sides of śobhā and upaśobhā:  
# 126  
O Goddess, one should write lotus and conch in the corners all around.  

# 127  
“All around” means in all of them.  

Having thus completed the entire maṇḍala up to the gates:  
# 128  
Outside it all around one should drop the lines of the bhūtas. ||18-46||  

# 129  
Five in number, meaning the bhūtas. ||18-47||  

And those:  
# 130  
By difference of colour…  

# 131  
From outside inward: white, red, black, yellow, pure.  

Because:  
# 132  
…nivṛtti etc. are those kalās.  

# 133  
For those proclaimed colours belong to Sadvojāta etc. that pervade Brahma.  

Because:  
# 134  
Outside, adorned with lotus-creepers, lotuses, svastikas—||18-47||  
having drawn the principal maṇḍala, in its centre one should worship Śrī.  

# 135  
And one should not draw the maṇḍala right at the beginning; rather:  
# 136  
The preliminary consecration should be performed according to capacity and extent. ||18-48||  

# 137  
Meaning: the consecration should be performed on the previous day. ||18-49||  

For that purpose, right from the start:  
# 138  
The Yāga-house should be made according to one’s power and materials,  
furnished with sandals, parasol, bed, and various beauties, ||18-49||  
shining with various flags. ||18-50||  

# 139  
And flags with various emblems. ||18-50||  

And this, from the propriety of the Yāga:  
# 140  
Provided with sandals, parasol, bed, and various adornments,  
and with household utensils and various enjoyments. ||18-50||  

# 141  
Furnished. ||18-51||  

For the Yāga:  
# 142  
Above, a canopy should be made, very white and delightful.  
Four curtains, eight lamps in the directions one should cause to be placed. ||18-51||  

# 143  
Furthermore:  
# 144  
Fans, bells, and four mirrors—  

# 145  
one should place in the four directions.  

And again in directions and intermediate directions:  
# 146  
Eight new excellent banners shining with various colours, ||18-52||  
eight kalaśas of silver, or copper, or even of clay—  

# 147  
should be placed.  

And in the kalaśas:  
# 148  
The eight oceans should likewise be worshipped…  

# 149  
and the kalaśas presided over by the oceans  
# 150  
…filled with all herbs, ||18-53||  
furnished with mango sprouts and gold, one should worship.  
Eight staffs of five colours one should place in directions and intermediate directions. ||18-54||  

# 151  
“Of five colours” means staffs. ||18-55||  

Outside that:  
# 152  
The guardians of the worlds should likewise be worshipped on cloths in their own forms.  

# 153  
Near the guardians of the worlds:  
# 154  
Likewise the form of the astra should be made in the ten directions all around. ||18-55||  

# 155  
“Likewise” means the form of the astra—vajra etc.—according to Indra etc. on cloths. “Ten” means above and below Brahmā and Ananta with weapons, placed in the north-east and south-west corners. ||18-56||  

Furthermore:  
# 156  
Outside that, the gate-keepers should be made according to the teaching of the Āmnāya.  

# 157  
Should be drawn and worshipped. “According to the teaching of the Āmnāya” means according to the established tradition: on the right of the gate Nandī and Gaṅgā, on the left Mahākāla and Yamunā; but in the Bhairava view it is reversed; in the left-current tradition as before Nandī-Gaṅgā etc. with Ḍiṇḍima and Mahodara; in the Trika view as in the Bhairava view but with additional Goat-face and Sheep-face, and so forth is to be followed. These are the special deities ending with the astras and guardians of the worlds.  

# 158  
Because this system is common to all, they should be made thus on the cloth. ||18-56||  

# 159  
Here is the procedure:  
# 160  
With Vedic auspicious sounds accompanied by victory cries and puṇyāha,  
with dancing, instrumental music, and various hymns—||18-57||  

# 161  
being furnished:  
# 162  
The ācārya, pure, skilful, smeared with sandal and aguru, ||18-58||  
furnished with washed sacred thread, adorned with turban and rings,  
with bracelets and great necklaces, adorned with garlands of flowers,  
attended by bearers of forms, incense-bearers, and likewise bearers of arghya, ||18-59||  
furnished with all requisites, preceded by consecration,  
having worshipped kumbha, astra, and Vardhanī, having taken possession of the site—||18-60||  

# 163  
thereafter, O Goddess, the supreme teacher should perform the dropping of powder.  
“Pure” means pure in mind, heart, and body. “Skilful” means energetic in worship, already smeared with sandal etc. simply because he has performed the daily rites. “Washed sacred thread” because his heart is filled with great light. “Turban” is a cloth-binding on the head. “Rings” are finger-rings. “Bearers of forms” means followed by disciples who are bearers of the eight forms beginning with earth up to Śarva, thus he is of one form with the eight-formed Maheśvara. In “and likewise bearers of arghya” etc., “furnished” is to be supplied. “All requisites” means the collection of substances proper for consecration; consecration means the purification of substances etc. according to the method taught in the revered Svacchanda etc., for the propriety of the Śiva-Yāga. Kumbha-Yāga is for completing all rites; astra-Yāga for removing obstacles. “Having taken possession of the site” means having taken the special place proper for the Yāga; “dropping of powder” means the special maṇḍala constructed according to the aforesaid procedure.  

In this maṇḍala:  
# 164  
Meditating with the aforesaid form, one should worship Mṛtyujit in the centre. ||18-61||  

# 165  
Mṛtyujit is the supreme form. ||18-62||  

Furthermore:  
# 166  
The Goddess seated on His lap, Śrī, the Mother of the universe,  
resembling pure crystal, shining like frost, kuṇḍa-flower, and moon, ||18-62||  
resembling a hundred moons, having lustre like cow’s milk,  
resembling a pearl, white, concealed by white garments, ||18-63||  
limbs smeared with white sandal, grey with camphor dust,  
adorned and shining with pure necklaces, moon-lustre, and other jewels, ||18-64||  
well adorned with white garlands and lotuses,  
whose limbs are beautiful with Viṣṇu’s smile, having a white smile, charming, ||18-65||  
furnished with a very white crown, one-faced, three-eyed,  
seated in padmāsana, adorned with yogapaṭṭa, ||18-66||  
holding conch and lotus, gentle, with hands granting boons and fearlessness,  
four-armed Great Goddess marked with all auspicious signs—||18-67||  
having meditated thus with varieties of feeling upon Her form, weapons, and ornaments.  

# 167  
One should worship—connection. Shining and adorned with pure necklaces, moon-lustre, and other jewels. “With varieties of feeling” means the practitioner whose mind is coloured by special desires. The rest is clear.  

Then, like the God, the limbs of the Goddess—He says:  
# 168  
One should fashion the limbs in exactly the same way as for Amṛteśa. ||18-68||  

# 169  
According to the method taught in the second chapter. And by thus teaching with a special statement here, he instructs that the limbs previously stated for all deities do not belong to these. ||18-69||  

Because the Goddess is entirely white:  
# 170  
One should worship with entirely white offerings the bestower of all siddhis.  

# 171  
Having stated the principal rule, he mentions another variety:  
# 172  
Or with this very procedure one may worship Śrīdhara together with Śrī, ||18-69||  
with devotion, O Goddess, bestowing all fruits of desire.  

# 173  
Alternatively, the Goddess alone:  
# 174  
With white pādyas, arghyas, flowers, clean incense, etc., ||18-70||  
with edibles, drinkables, suckables, and various chewables that are auspicious,  
one should worship the Supreme Sovereign bestowing the fruit of all siddhis. ||18-71||  

# 175  
At the end of worship, after japa:  
# 176  
In the previously constructed kuṇḍa, with the homa stated earlier,  
one should satisfy the Sovereign of the gods and goddesses with a mind full of devotion. ||18-72||  

# 177  
“With the previously stated” means with the homa of sesame, milk, ghee, sugar, etc.; thus the connection is: one should satisfy the Śakti of the God of gods. ||18-73||  

He mentions another variety for the Goddess:  
# 178  
Or the eight-armed Goddess, holding a jewel in her hand, auspicious,  
ever holding a kalaśa filled with amṛta, ||18-73||  
the Goddess holding sun and moon, seated upon a white lotus,  
above the nidhis, adorned with auspicious elephants. ||18-74||  
Worshipped and praised always by the hosts of gods beginning with Brahmā,  
meditated upon, japa-ed—O Maheśānī, bestowing the fruit of siddhi and liberation. ||18-75||  

# 179  
Above the previous four hands holding conch, lotus, boon, and fearlessness, additionally holding jewel, amṛta-kalaśa, sun, and moon—eight-armed. Seated upon the white lotus that is above the nidhis. Adornment with auspicious elephants means being sprinkled by elephants raising pitchers with their trunks. She is the Great Sovereign of Maheśāna; therefore worshipped by Brahmā etc. For from worshipping Her they have obtained their own portions. This is stated in the revered Svacchanda. ||18-76||  

Alternatively:  
# 180  
One should fully worship the Sovereign of the gods and goddesses placed in a kumbha  
according to the aforesaid procedure in the auspicious Yāga previously stated. ||18-76||  

# 181  
Moreover:  
# 182  
Having japa-ed Śrī seated in the centre of the kumbha with the aforesaid meditation-yoga  
one hundred and eight times, one should consecrate as before. ||18-77||  
“As before” means with the procedure of puṇyāha-recitation, auspicious sounds, etc.  

# 183  
Whichever practitioner the ācārya consecrates—  
# 184  
for him Mahālakṣmī becomes immovable, or kingship, or whatever he desires.  

# 185  
becomes—completion.  

Furthermore, such a consecrated practitioner obtains earthly, atmospheric, and heavenly auspicious sovereignty. ||18-78||  

And whatever else  
# 186  
he may desire…  

# 187  
all that the worshipped Goddess, pleased,  

# 188  
…gives him.  

# 189
Furthermore:  

# 190  
Longevity, strength, fame, glory, intellect, beauty, the body of Śrī—||18-79||  
all these increase for him in whose house She is worshipped.  

# 191  
Thus it is.  

# 192  
Whoever is consecrated…  

# 193  
or whoever, according to the aforesaid meditation etc.,  
# 194  
…practises, O beloved, ||18-80||  

# 195  
this Goddess—  

# 196  
he obtains all that was stated before and produces peace and nourishment.  

# 197
Furthermore, according to the aforesaid meditation etc.:  

# 198  
The Goddess drawn on cloth who is worshipped in whose house ||18-81||  
according to the aforesaid procedure gives him everything.  

# 199  
the desired fruit.  

For one devoted to this worship:  
# 200  
Why say much here? Just as deer flee in all directions ||18-82||  
from a lion, so thousands of evil defects flee in all directions.  
What need of multitudes of other mantras and worship of deities ||18-83||  
where this Sovereign of the gods and goddesses is meditated, japa-ed, well worshipped?  

# 201  
There for the practitioner—completion; evil beings such as bhūtas, epilepsy, etc.; defects such as diseases and poverty, etc.  

Moreover, this one:  
# 202  
At the time of battle should be meditated upon seated on a sword-blade creeper. ||18-84||  

# 203  
When this is done:  
# 204  
She grants victory to him and destroys the pride of enemies.  

# 205  
Moreover:  
Always at the forefront of battle She should be worshipped by one desiring to conquer enemy kingdoms. ||18-85||  
“At the forefront” means at the beginning. ||18-86||  

# 206  
Inevitably he obtains victory through the grace of the God of gods’ consort.  

# 207
Furthermore:  

# 208  
Even one afflicted by hundreds of diseases or tormented by painful defects, ||18-86||  
covered with all sins, afflicted by kṛtyā, khārkhoda, etc.,  
by mantras, yantras, meditations, japa, homa, poisons, etc.—||18-87||  

# 209  
whoever is tormented by mantras, yantras, etc. employed by others—connection: he too obtains victory through the grace of the Goddess. ||18-88||  

Furthermore, this one:  
# 210  
Whatever powders, ointments, collyriums, and magical devices  
enemies or women may perform against a man—||18-88||  
worshipped according to that procedure, She becomes their Pratyaṅgirā.  

# 211  
Powders etc. for subjugation, driving away, etc. Magical devices mean yantra-kṛtyās etc. Whatever enemies may perform—She worshipped according to the stated procedure; meaning: for the person against whom the magical device etc. is performed, She becomes Pratyaṅgirā, meaning like a wrongly discharged weapon She destroys the enemies’ own side.  

Moreover:  
# 212  
Whoever, taking refuge in this supreme Goddess, worships Her with devotion—||18-89||  

# 213  
he obtains what he desires—meaning. ||18-90||  

Therein:  
# 214  
In such a way that She is not seen by evil men delighting in sinful conduct,  
by mantra-siddhas, by cheats, by all thorns likewise—||18-90||  
thus She should be worshipped well concealed; concealed, She becomes bestower of siddhi.  

# 215  
“By mantra-siddhas, cheats” means by those who have worshipped mantras for petty siddhis. “By all thorns” means by Śākinīs etc.  

Thus it is:  
# 216  
In Yāga, homa, japa, mudrā, and meditation-yoga—||18-91||  
he who meditates upon the Goddess well concealed becomes possessor of good fortune.  

# 217  
“With meditation-yoga” means he who, well concealed through meditation-yoga, meditates upon the Goddess—connection.  

He establishes this very point:  
# 218  
From this many evil ones desire to destroy pleasures, ||18-92||  
others deprived of good fortune, tormented by ill fortune,  
always behold the Yāga, homa, japa, and meditation-procedure—||18-93||  

# 219  
they generate great obstacles; therefore the procedure is most secret.  
Evil ones: the most sinful delighting in petty rites. “Pleasures” and by the “ca” even body, wealth, etc. “Behold the Yāga, homa” etc.—the “ca” is for equal connection: they behold and always generate obstacles—meaning.  

He concludes the meaning:  
# 220  
She should be worshipped by the wise practitioner with varieties of feeling, ||18-94||  
or worshipped according to the single-hero sequence, O Sovereign of the gods.  
Pleased, the Supreme Sovereign grants all desires—||18-95||  

# 221  
wise means knowing pervasion. “All desires” and by the “ca” even liberation. ||18-96||  

He clarifies the statement “with varieties of feeling”:  

# 222  
Worshipped well according to the difference of Śaiva, Vaiṣṇava, and Siddhānta,  
the Supreme Sovereign becomes bestower of fruit according to the difference in the minds of devotees. ||18-96||  

# 223
Furthermore:  

# 224  
Just as the wish-fulfilling gem in the world bestows the fruit of desired objects,  
so this Mahālakṣmī bestows the fruit of all desires. ||18-97||  

# 225  
And this is Her glory:  

# 226  
Gods, asuras, men, nāgas, gandharvas, kinnaras,  
daityas, dānavas always, Yakṣas, rākṣasas, piśācas, ||18-98||  
bhūtas, vetālas, Yoginīs, mātṛs, guhyakas likewise,  
Ḍākinīs, Ḍāmarikā goddesses, sisters, messengers likewise, ||18-99||  
and all lords of yoga, intensely eager for Yāga-siddhi—  
all these, through the grace of great siddhi, have become accomplished and well-accomplished. ||18-100||  

# 227  
Piśācas: dwellers in impure places etc., torch-faced; bhūtas: very powerful, like Kṣetrapālas; vetālas: entered into dead bodies, dwellers in cremation grounds; Yoginīs: attained power through yoga-practice; mātṛs: belonging to the retinue beginning with Brāhmī; lords of yoga: those who are lords through union with the supreme reality by yoga, not seekers of limited siddhi; yoga-accomplished: those whose standpoint is siddhi obtained through the power of yoga; well-accomplished means having obtained their own appropriate siddhis according to varieties of feeling. ||18-101||  

For this Goddess  
# 228  
is the source of all siddhis, Mahālakṣmī, greatly powerful,  
bestower of excellence to devotees and practitioners who take refuge. ||18-101||  

# 229  
bestowing all enjoyment and liberation—meaning. ||18-102||  

# 230  
There is no other in the world more gracious than Her.  
The aṇimā etc. powers and whatever others such as omniscience—||18-102||  
all these are accomplished through Her grace; therein no doubt.  

# 231  
And this Yāga stated above  
# 232  
should be performed by one desiring liberation according to the single-hero method as before. ||18-103||  

# 233  
the subject of the revered Amṛteśa alone. ||18-104||  

For one desiring enjoyment, to accomplish enjoyment another variety—He says:  
# 234  
Or one may install the Lord united with Śakti  
according to the aforesaid requisites in a beautiful temple. ||18-104||  
Having installed the union of Śakti and Śaktimat according to rule—  

# 235  
according to rule means with knowledge of pervasion. Having installed the union of Śakti and Śaktimat—having attained the absorption of Rudra and His Śakti which is the harmony of knowledge and action—  
he who installs the God together with Mahālakṣmī in a temple with requisites:  

# 236  
Whatever sin he has accumulated in thousands of previous births, ||18-105||  
that perishes in an instant, O Goddess, like a heap of cotton in fire.  

# 237
Furthermore:  

# 238  
Even merely desired, the Lord of gods installed by the initiated ||18-106||  
lifts up the entire clan…  

# 239  
the entire clan means lifts up the paternal etc. clans.  

How?  
# 240  
…ten previous and ten later.  

# 241  
Meaning lifts up ten ancestors and ten descendants in each line.  

Furthermore:  
# 242  
As long as in temple, liṅga, image, painted wall, ||18-107||  
in stone, in metals, and in flags, flag-poles,  
the counting of atoms lasts, so long he enjoys. ||18-108||  
As long as oceans, rivers, mountains, moon, sun, and earths—  
having enjoyed enjoyments in the tattva of Sadāśiva, he would attain nirvāṇa. ||18-109||  

# 243  
Stones: those of the outer wall; metals: plaster etc. in the temple; flags: those with trident etc. The connection is “as long as the counting of atoms.” He enjoys. “Oceans” etc. for the purpose of indicating long duration. As it is said:  
# 244  
“As many atoms as there are in image, liṅga, and altar…”  

# 245  
etc. ||18-110||  

He illustrates the nature of nirvāṇa with an example:  
# 246  
Just as a river reaching the ocean becomes one with it,  
so the bound soul attaining Śiva-nature is liberated from the ocean of existence. ||18-110||  

# 247  
River means stream. Attaining Śiva-nature: having obtained identity with the supreme Śiva. “Bound soul” is said with reference to the previous state. ||18-111||  

Thus the installer  
# 248  
obtains this fruit of installation; therein no doubt.  

# 249  
Having thus taught the Yāga and installation of Mahālakṣmī, to speak of the special initiation for raising the dead, with preliminary explanation—He says:  
# 250  
When a king is uninitiated, his sons, twice-born, ||18-111||  
or those lazy in enjoyment, O Goddess, obstructed by defects of rites—  

# 251  
“Uninitiated” means in all cases without having obtained initiation; but even in the case of a king or his sons who have initiation, the possibility of sin from improper ruling; in twice-born even with initiation, from non-abandonment of strong caste-pride; “lazy in enjoyment” means even in those initiated with seed etc., from non-attachment to caste-enjoyments, fallen from vows; or even one who observes vows but whose vows are broken due to obstruction by divine defect—such persons when dead, for lifting up those whose descent of śaktipāta has come through relatives etc., the supreme Lord should be worshipped for initiation—connection with the future text.  

Furthermore, those in whom  
# 252  
neither austerity was practised, nor meditated, nor installed, ||18-112||  
nor Yāga etc. performed with respect to the supreme Lord—  

# 253  
in those fallen by water-binding, blow of fist, etc.  

# 254  
whose state is in hell due to falling— ||18-113||  

# 255
Furthermore:  

# 256  
By many causes, O Goddess, child, woman, old, afflicted—  

# 257  
by causes such as spider-bite, poison, eating by petty yogins, falling from height, etc., when child etc. die, falling into hell etc. is possible.  

In all those when dead:  
# 258  
For lifting them up, for initiation, the supreme Lord ||18-114||  
should be worshipped as before…  

# 259  
Lifting up means drawing from the hell-region by the method of mantra-net yoga; for the sake of enjoyment and liberation, the initiation that is for cutting bonds—for its accomplishment the Lord should be worshipped with requisites as before.  

Furthermore:  
# 260  
…especially there the effigy  
must be made of powder, resembling, twelve fingers, ||18-115||  
or made of cow-dung, O Goddess, or with kuśa grasses purified by bathing.  

# 261  
With powder of rice. “Of silver” is a corrupt reading. “Resembling” means resembling the dead body.  

And here no preliminary consecration should be performed—He says:  
# 262  
Initiation itself there is the purification…  

# 263  
Only after worship of the Lord and homa—  
“With the great net named procedure: from the mūlādhāra arises the widely spread endless channel-staff; overpowering with virility, scattering the sky entered through the nose, desiring to pervade; covering the wheel of the path with a great mass of very lovely smoke-flames, bringing the desired souls.” (Tantrāloka 21-25)  
—thus with the tradition taught by the guru, by contemplation of the Māyā-bīja, with the Māyā-net, or  
# 264  
“In the centre nāda, six vowels, a-varga, ka-ca, va-ña;  
a-ṇa, ṭa-ta, ṅa-ña-ṇa: feet; aṣṭa-aṇu yā-dayo: head.”  

# 265  
—thus by the procedure of the mātṛkā-net with sixfold repetition of the central nāda, the aforesaid person to be initiated  
# 266  
…should be brought into presence with pervasion. ||18-116||  

# 267  
“With pervasion” means from absorption in the universal pervading consciousness-abode. As it is said in the revered Haṃsapārameśvara:  
# 268  
“Śarva-worship is on a sthaṇḍila; there is no consecration there.”  

# 269  
Beginning thus:  
# 270  
“Niṣkala, sakala, peaceful—I myself am the supreme Śiva,  
the supreme Self, all-pervading; the entire universe is pervaded by me.  
Thus meditating, one should perform expiration and inspiration.  
At the end of kumbhaka, with expiration one should slowly deposit everything.  
At the end of expiration again in one’s own heart, in the Dvādaśānta, one’s own Śakti  
should be perceived sprout-like, moving within all eggs.  
Pronouncing the Māyā-bīja united with consciousness and liṅga,  
pure like a drop of water, where it is stationed in the channel—  
seizing that with the procedure of the great net skilfully,  
the seized heart should be placed accompanied by the calling of the bīja.”  

# 271  
Thus. ||18-117||  

Having thus brought one or many:  
# 272  
One should join the atoms in that…  

# 273  
should place in one effigy of one person or in many.  

Then, having performed complete purification of the path as in living initiation, that effigy like a flame  
# 274  
…should be cast with the full oblation.  

# 275  
One should offer into the supreme Śiva-fire.  
# 276  
With the unifier into the Śiva-tattva…  

# 277  
by the method of the unifier taught in the revered Svacchanda etc., one should unite him in the Śiva-tattva.  

Thus initiated by the excellent awakened supreme ācārya:  
# 278  
…then he becomes participant in union. ||18-117||  

# 279  
He goes to identity with Śiva. ||18-118||  

Or for the grace of the aforesaid persons:  
# 280  
In śrāddha one should worship the God, or perform the final sacrifice.  

# 281  
There the Saiddhāntika śrāddha procedure is well-known; but in the secret method:  
# 282  
“The guru, meditating upon the expansive Śakti that is of the form of food, possessing virility,  
should contemplate the target as possessed by Her.  
Then whatever bond-portion of his is of the form of enjoyment, he should offer it.  
United with the enjoyer in oneness of being, the disciple thus becomes Śiva.”  

# 283  
—thus it is taught only with the method of offering naivedya; the raising of the dead is the final sacrifice on the dead body; but in the revered Siddhā:  
# 284  
“The final should be the former; having done that, the final as the first.  
Contracting each one by one, the double final sacrifice is considered.  
Not at the time when burnt by worship, meditation, japa; not for the practitioner.  
Freed by the falling of the piṇḍa etc., he would become a sky-farer, O beloved.  
For an ācārya accomplished in tattvas, wherever he dies,  
no final sacrifice exists on a pure-minded one’s head.  
Those killed by mantras etc. in hells—  
for them the final sacrifice here should be performed by a very compassionate guru.”  

# 285  
—thus taught. In the Vīra sequence, because of reverse mantra, it should be performed for two putrakas at the time, not for an accomplished practitioner who has abandoned identification with the body on the head, in the mass of consciousness-bliss. In the revered Kularṇava also:  
# 286  
“Whosoever have fallen from vows, whosoever hate the path,  
having obtained the path abandon it, whosoever are low men—  
therefore, O great fortunate one, I teach you their final sacrifice.”  

# 287  
—thus final-sacrifice initiation for those fallen from vows etc. is taught.  

Now, grace should be performed for those to be graced by installation in the abode of the dead—He says:  
# 288  
Likewise, O Goddess, in a burnt piṇḍa in the cremation ground ||18-118||  
with the aforesaid material requisites by the guru according to previous rule.  
The aforesaid terrifying form united with the pair of Śaktis—||18-119||  

# 289  
In a burnt piṇḍa means in the place of the consumed body. The aforesaid means the Bhairava form with the pair of Śaktis, emaciated and plump. ||18-120||  

Alternatively, in the middle with Bhairava on the sides:  
# 290  
Four or eight, O Goddess, contemplated in previous meditation.  

# 291  
Four beginning with Siddhā, eight with the dūtīs beginning with Kālī, contemplated—truly meditated upon in the meditation taught in the tenth chapter—should be installed.  

For whomever installation is thus performed:  
# 292  
he obtains the aforesaid fruit—command of the Supreme Sovereign. ||18-120||  

# 293  
He attains the Lakshmi of enjoyment for a very long time—auspicious. ||18-121||  

By what name and form of the supreme Lord of consciousness do we worship the flashing Eye for the grace of the worlds?  

Thus, on the Śrī Netra Tantra,  
in the *Netrodyota* composed by the venerable Kṣemarāja,  
who is supreme among the great Ācāryas devoted to Maheśvara,  
this concludes the eighteenth chapter:
**Amriteshvari and the Way in Which She Is to Be Adored**
