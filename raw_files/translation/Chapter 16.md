Sixteenth Chapter  
Neṭrodyotaḥ: The Illumination of the Eye

# 2  
That which, through rites of manifold and marvellous variety,  
bears fruits of form both variegated and wondrous,  
yet reveals the utterly unvariegated, self-luminous flashing forth  
of the Self whose sole nature is the One Consciousness —

# 3  
and which rests upon the radiant, marvellous play of its own glory  
that abides in the variegated manifestations of the universe —

# 4  
we praise that Eye of Śarva,  
the Eye without equal,  
overflowing with the rapture of incomparable bliss.

# 5  
Having in the previous chapter expounded the nature of the blessed Mṛtyujit who is identical with all deities, and now desiring to determine the proper observances, rites, and disciplines that are the means of attaining Him, the blessed Goddess spoke:

# 6  
“O Lord of Gods, Thou hast revealed a supreme and most marvellous secret:  
the One Hero, the All-containing, of immeasurable might.” ||15||

# 7  
Through the threefold division of the Left-hand, Right-hand, and Siddhānta paths,

# 8  
united with Vaiṣṇava and other forms, Thou hast proclaimed Him complete with His secret. ||16-1||  
He in whom all deities dwell, Mṛtyujit, all-pervading Śiva,  
must be worshipped through many lineages according to diverse inner dispositions. ||16-2||  
Through manifold rites and offerings He bestows manifold perfections.  
Now I wish to hear: a doubt has arisen in my heart. ||16-3||  
Apart from Thee, no one can resolve this doubt.  
Formerly, O Lord, Thou didst speak of separate observances for each path. ||16-4||  
How then, in this case, is a common observance taught that was previously declared?

# 9  
The secret nature of “containing all scriptures” has been made clear by this statement. “One” means without second. “Hero” means capable of accomplishing all works. “Of great might” means He whose very essence is the potency of all mantras. “United with Vaiṣṇava etc.” means perfectly pervading the Vaiṣṇava form and, by the particle “etc.”, the Brahma, Saura, and other forms as well. “With secret” means taught according to the Kula tradition. “All-pervading” is the reason He contains all deities; therefore He is Śiva, whose nature is supreme non-duality and highest bliss. “Lineages” means those possessing the knowledge and practice taught in each scripture. “According to diversity of inner disposition” means according to what is suitable to the worshipper’s mind. From the words “I wish to hear” the topic is indicated by the verse beginning “separately”. “Previously” refers to the various tantras taught earlier. “Common” means that, because the Lord has a great all-inclusive form, worship must be performed with a common observance alone; the intended remainder is that no particular observance is perceived. “Previously declared” refers to the earlier statement in the ninth chapter:

# 10  
“Thus the all-pervading Lord, like a gem of many forms…  
is worshipped by all, O Goddess, out of desire for the fruit of perfect accomplishment.” (9-14)  
and so on, where worship was taught in a common manner alone.

# 11  
Moreover:

# 12  
“How can all deities, when worshipped through a single mantra, grant accomplishment?” ||16-5||

# 13  
Because in scripture after scripture it is said:

# 14  
“Through seeds, peaks, cores, garland-mantras – completely,  
by the distinction of signified and signifier – they bestow all perfections.” ||16-6||

# 15  
Seeds are vowels; peaks are condensed syllables; cores are those beginning with the nine-syllabled mantra, etc.; garland-mantras are those consisting of strings of words. The distinction between signified and signifier is that seeds predominate in Parā Vāk (Supreme Speech), cores in Paśyantī, garland-mantras in Madhyamā, and peaks in both Paśyantī and Madhyamā.

# 16  
Therefore, for those many mantras that have manifold signified deities,  
how can a man become fit for worship through a single mantra?  
Or how can all the gods become gracious to men? ||7||  
For the benefit of mankind, out of compassion, O Supreme Lord…

# 17  
How, through a single common mantra whose particular characteristics are unknown, can all the gods – Brahma, Viṣṇu and the rest – become gracious when men are ignorant of those particular characteristics? This is the meaning.

Moreover:

# 18  
“Having reached the Kali age, afflicted men attain accomplishment… ||16-8||  
tormented by the fire of poverty, accompanied by fear of manifold deaths,  
devoted solely to sin, full of anger, excluded from purity and proper conduct, ||16-9||  
addicted to violence and slander, devoid of austerity and truth,  
marked by Yoginīs, Śākinīs, Ḍākinīs, Ḍāmarikās and the like,  
by ghosts, Yakṣas, seizures – thus are living beings stamped. ||16-10||  
Tell me, O Maheśvara, how they, freed from exertion, attain accomplishment.” ||16-11||

# 19  
The connection is: Tell me the method by which they attain accomplishment, whether supreme or inferior, that removes great suffering, poverty, and the like. Purity pertains to mind, wealth, and body. The nature of Śākinīs etc. will be shown later.

To resolve this question, the blessed Lord said:

# 20  
“Well spoken, well spoken, O Greatly Blessed One! I shall tell thee exactly as thou hast asked.”

# 21  
Having thus promised, and taking up what was said about “reaching the Kali age”, He first says:

# 22  
“Of short lifespan, with minds overpowered by delusion, ||16-12||  
ever delighting in evil conduct, serving bad company,  
blamers, strong, cruel, subdued by old age and disease, ||16-13||  
foolish devotees of evil conduct, ever serving jealousy,  
of fearful appearance, tormented by the fire of poverty, ||16-14||  
proclaiming atheism, evil, accompanied by thievish behaviour,  
devoid of devotion to gods and guru, serving the basest envy – ||16-15||  
by difficult vows, fasts, restraints at sacred sites, and the like,  
all those are without accomplishment; verily they are not liberated.” ||16-16||

# 23  
For their deliverance, however,

# 24  
there is the King of Mantras of great might.  
“By whichever disposition contemplated and worshipped, O Fair-Eyed One,  
they reach the supreme state, nirvāṇa, the supreme medicine. ||16-17||  
The Kali age shall be most terrible, O Great Goddess;  
for that purpose this supreme truth, Thy Māyā, has been manifested.” ||16-18||

# 25  
From the very beginning, with the intention of the compassionate One, the meaning is “by Me”. “This” refers to the form of the Lord Mṛtyujit.

Moreover, in every way:

# 26  
“The supreme truth, supreme, is Mṛtyujit, facing all directions. ||16-19||  
He must be worshipped, by one desiring liberation and accomplishment, according to diversity of inner disposition.”

# 27  
He whose faces are all directions – that is, whose doors are the meditations upon each deity etc., whose means of attainment – who, by supreme non-dual pervasion of pure consciousness and bliss, by cutting apart the differentiated cognitions and affections such as attachment, is the supreme truth, the supreme object of attainment – Mṛtyujit must be worshipped by the seeker of liberation. And for those who rely on fixed forms and fixed rites, observances are certainly to be adopted. He says:

# 28  
“Whichever observances I have taught in the scriptures, ||16-20||  
those must be performed in the channels, especially in sacrifice and oblation.”

# 29  
The meaning is that variegation of form, variegation of substances, etc., must not be practised.

If it be objected that variegation of observances is also constituted of non-difference of consciousness, then it is said that there must be regulation of form just as there is regulation of observance:

# 30  
“Worship is not that which is performed with flowers and the like –  
it is the firm intention directed toward the boundless, non-conceptual sky.  
That alone is true worship; it is dissolution through reverence.”  
(Vijñānabhairava 147)

# 31  
Thus alone does it remain. For the supreme yogin who has attained this state and constantly enjoys the secret worship that has arisen spontaneously, there is nothing whatever to be done. As our Lords have said in the hymn:

# 32  
“Of Thee, O Mother, there is no praise that is not praise,

# 33  
for Thy very body consists of all sounds.

# 34  
In all forms my connection with Thee exists,

# 35  
and in the senses that rush outward.

# 36  
Thus reflecting upon Thee who art Śiva, who dost calm all that is unquiet,

# 37  
this world has arisen in me without effort.  
Devoid of praise, repetition, worship, and meditation,  
truly no moment or part of time exists for me.”

# 38  
For those desiring to enter the abode of non-duality, regulation of observance is like regulation of form; yet even there, the meditation upon the potency of the mantra that causes supreme non-dual Śiva has been taught as superior.

But if the existence of other common mantras such as Praṇava be granted, why this extraordinary pre-eminence of this one alone? Anticipating this doubt, with the intention that the cause here is solely the command of the Supreme Maheśvara, He says:  
Other mantras, O Goddess, even when treated as common, never accomplish anything. ||16-21||

# 39  
But in this mantra-king there exists authority in all three paths that bestows all perfections.

# 40  
“Threefold, in the three.” (1-1)

# 41  
In the threefold nature of reality explained in the commentary on that verse, the authority to bestow all perfections exists in this very mantra-king, who is of the nature of all-in-all and of supreme pervasion, through the divine command that was previously declared: “The Lord of Gods, all-containing, supreme,  
the common Lord of mantras, signifier of all without exception.” (14-8)

# 42  
“Lord of Gods, all-containing, supreme,  
the common Lord of mantras, signifier of all without exception.” (14-8)

# 43  
Therefore, because it signifies even the special mantras of the Krama, Kula, Ṣaḍardha, and other systems, it is declared to be both common and uncommon, both general and particular, say the teachers.

Because it is so:

# 44  
Whether in dualistic, non-dual, or mixed paths, He who is desired becomes the bestower of accomplishment. ||22||

# 45  
Because the all-pervading Lord is of universal form, like a gem.  
He whose form is the universe is the universe manifested through His own freedom; therefore, though the One Hero, even while One Hero, He assumes the form of universal duality through freedom, yet because that form too shines resting upon the ground of non-dual conscious light, He is both dual and non-dual. Therefore, being the supreme non-dual Absolute, because of His all-pervasiveness, He who is desired in the special tantras of dual, non-dual, and mixed paths becomes the bestower of accomplishment. The gem here is the wish-fulfilling gem.

Moreover, He does not merely grant liberation in life through supreme non-dual pervasion; according to the desire of the sādhaka He certainly becomes the bestower of whatever accomplishment is wished for. ||16-23||

# 46  
Certainly He becomes the bestower of all perfections. ||24||

# 47  
He concludes this:

# 48  
He who is the all-pervading Lord, the all-containing, the omnipresent –  
He is the giver of accomplishment and liberation; castes have no ultimate reality. ||16-24||  
Therefore, O Goddess, He must always be worshipped according to diversity of inner disposition.

# 49  
Because the Great Lord, whose nature is autonomous non-dual consciousness, truly bestows accomplishment and liberation, whereas castes, being indistinguishable from other castes in their caste-nature, do not – therefore the Lord of Mantras, whose essence is the supreme realisation of the flashing autonomous consciousness that is pure, must be worshipped by seekers of enjoyment and liberation according to diversity of inner disposition. For even seekers of enjoyment, having first realised the abode of non-duality, when engaging in action are not overcome by obstacles – thus has the blessed Sarvācāra-Bhaṭṭāraka declared. The words beginning “He who…” have already been explained.

Now:

# 50  
I shall now declare the place of sacrifice: it is performed according to wish. ||16-25||  
On the summit of a mountain, on a river bank, in a cow-pen, or in an open square,  
in a forest or pleasant grove, according to place and time, ||16-26||  
completely free of all thorns, devoid of evil beings,  
where virtuous and righteous people dwell, free from sinful conduct, ||16-27||  
where the citizens never indulge in slander,  
whom the evil, the mixed, the utterly degenerate never see, ||16-28||  
in such a place one should sacrifice with the great mantra, avoiding all defects.

# 51  
Sacrifice (Yāga) is the offering of substances with intention toward the deity.  
“According to wish” means: wherever desire arises — on a mountain-top or elsewhere — there, without transgression of that desire, the rite is to be performed.  
“According to place and time” means in conformity with what is convenient for place and time.  
“Virtuous and righteous people dwell” is a compound: a place where both virtue and righteousness reside together.  
“Mixed” (saṅkīrṇa) means those born against the proper order; “utterly degenerate” means those in whom every kind of mingling with the lowest, most sinful, and violent exists.  
Defects (iti) are excessive rain and the like.

Alternatively:

# 52  
Sacrifice in the home is to be performed by ācāryas who directly see the truth. ||16-29||

# 53  
Without direct vision of the truth there is no ācāryaship whatsoever.

And such a rite

# 54  
must be performed in utmost secrecy, especially in pacification rites.

# 55  
The word “especially” also enjoins secrecy even in obligatory (nitya) rites.

In occasional (naimittika) rites there is no strict rule because the chief aim is bestowal of grace; therefore He says:

# 56  
At the time of initiation the maṇḍala is to be drawn wherever one happens to be. ||16-30||

# 57  
Whether in the home or on a mountain-top or elsewhere. ||31||

But in rites performed for a specific desire (kāmyā) the place must be completely secret; therefore:

# 58  
In rites for peace and increase one must certainly perform the worship in utmost secrecy, with effort.

# 59  
“Certainly” means having made it absolutely definite.

Here is the reason for this:

# 60  
Because in the world one sees those hostile to accomplishment who delight in violence. ||31||

# 61  
Those called “accomplishment-destroyers” — vile Yoginīs, bhūtas, piśācas and the like — are seen to delight in violence; therefore utmost secrecy alone is proper. ||16-32||

For by them

# 62  
nailing of mantras, breaking, bewildering,  

# 63  
terrifying, striking, paralysing, stupefying,  
turning into enemies, and the very state of Pratyaṅgirā —  
all destruction is wrought by evil mantra-wielders. ||32–33||

# 64  
There (in the tradition) it is taught:  
“One should imagine a blazing flame, enter from the big toe up to the head,  
turn face downward, place oneself in the region of the downward-moving breath,  
conceive the target as resembling burnt wood or charred timber in the form of a sacrificial offering,  
and, having mentally abandoned its body—merely by this contemplation, the cutting of the mantra is accomplished.  
Nailing, bewildering, and loss of brilliance likewise occur.  
The protective circle is broken—this is certain; there is no doubt herein.  
He becomes hated by all; his mantra does not succeed.”

# 65  
Thus by a contemplation accompanied by meditation,

# 66  
and likewise by the yantra taught in the Kula-arṇava:  
“In the space between two ka-s, write the name;  
outside it, draw the abode of fire adorned with eight ra-s.  
Having written it, place the yantra in a double skull-bowl.  
By this name, O Mahāgaurī, the cutting of that person’s mantra occurs,  
loss of siddhi arises, and he becomes hated by all.”

# 67  
and by the method of enveloping with ā, ṛ, etc., taught in the revered Ucchuṣma-tantra and others,  
together with the yoga established in the body, these evil ones perform striking and the rest.

Nailing is forcing into a different state; breaking is causing abandonment of direct confrontation with the target; bewildering is rendering powerless; paralysing is infusing incapacity to act; stupefying is producing motionlessness; the state of Pratyaṅgirā is causing the mantra employed for subduing bhūtas etc. to act adversely against its very user. The rest is clear. ||16-34||

# 68  
Thus in ten ways the violent ones strive.  
Therefore with every effort, above a sanctuary in utmost secrecy, ||34||  
in one’s own house one should zealously perform sacrifice, oblation, and repetition.

# 69  
“Because” supplies the reason. “In one’s own house” — because there it is possible to make it secret according to one’s liking.

Moreover, this mantra

# 70  
always bestows the highest fruit, supreme, when performed in utmost secrecy, O Mṛtyujit. ||16-35||  
In maṇḍala, in raised altar, in water-vessel, with mind free of doubt.

# 71  
With mind fully convinced that “fruit here and in the next world certainly arises,”  
the Lord placed in vessel etc. in utmost secrecy is ever to be worshipped for the desired fruit.

Moreover

# 72  
Likewise oblation on the top of a palace especially bestows peace and increase. ||16-36||

# 73  
“Likewise” means with utmost secrecy and with absence of doubt. ||16-37||

Moreover

# 74  
Here, O Queen of Gods, no alternative view…

# 75  
is to be entertained.

For

# 76  
…from entertaining alternatives one goes to Raurava hell.

# 77  
Thus it is said elsewhere:

# 78  
“I see no other flaw in mantra-practitioners during mantra-accomplishment  
as great as this: he merely wavers without embracing it fully.”

# 79  
Thus.

Therefore the sādhaka who is without wavering

# 80  
performs sacrifice and oblation there itself — that grants the fruit of all accomplishments. ||37||

# 81  
But one who proceeds with doubt

# 82  
is to be known as a thief; he causes loss of accomplishment.  
He is never qualified in this supreme Pārameśvara tantra. ||16-38||

# 83  
By proceeding with distrustful heart and deceitfully in the supreme Pārameśvara teaching, he is bound like a thief — this is the meaning. ||16-39||

Since this is so,

# 84  
the giver of all, O Goddess, becomes he who knows reality, knows the paths, the Guru.

# 85  
The knower of reality (tattva-vit) is he whose own essential nature is the supreme Śiva — dense mass of realised light and bliss.  
The knower of the paths (adhva-vit) is he who, through the unfolding of the power of action, creatively reflects the universe.  
Because this is so, he alone is capable of bestowing every fruit that shines forth from his own station.

Moreover,

# 86  
He who knows this pervasion in its division into transcendent and immanent ||39||  
becomes the very deliverer, the very Śiva who is the supreme cause.

# 87  
Just as siddhi belongs to sādhakas, so liberation belongs to knowers of reality alone — this is the meaning.  
The qualification “the very Śiva who is the supreme cause” is given here so that no suspicion may arise, as in dualistic doctrines, that liberated Śivas are different from the supreme Śiva.

He strengthens this very point through the negative approach:

# 88  
He who performs initiation without knowing the Śiva-principle ||16-40||

# 89  
together with him, those initiated by him do not attain liberation; rather

# 90  
like a blind man led by a blind man, all of them fall into a pit.

# 91  
The particle “eva” hints that one who lacks even the slightest opening of the supreme Eye of realised Śiva-principle has no illumination at all.

Therefore, even though he be not qualified, one who engages in initiation merely for livelihood

# 92  
leads himself and his disciples into the dire straits of hell. ||16-41||

# 93  
Since this is so,

# 94  
therefore the ācārya who knows reality, the blessed one, becomes the bestower of everything.

# 95  
“Blessed” means embraced by the Lakṣmī of liberation while still living.

And without being a knower of reality, even a ritual-performing ācārya has no proper authority to act; therefore He says:

# 96  
Until one is a knower of reality belonging to Śiva, how can he cause rites to be performed? ||16-42||  
The knower of mantra, in the great sacrifice of mantras, whether for another or for himself.

# 97  
In the sacrifice that consists of mantras — whose essence is the potency of the supreme power that protects through contemplation — the rites of worship, oblation, initiation, etc., in the Śiva-adhva (the Śaiva path),  
until one is a knower of reality whose own nature is the supreme Great Lord,  
and therefore a knower of mantra whose essence is the great potency that flashes forth from That,  
how can such an ācārya in the Śaiva teaching cause rites to be performed?  
How can those who merely perform mantra-rites actually employ them?  
“Whether for another or even for himself” means: he is incapable of accomplishing anything even for himself, how much less for another.

Objection: By the greatness of mantra, maṇḍala, etc., initiation will succeed; what need has the ācārya of knowledge of reality?

The Great Lord removes the delusion of those whose effort is limited to drawing a coloured maṇḍala, nyāsa of mantras, recitation, and offering of sesame and ghee:

# 98  
Until mantras are perfectly pure, how can accomplishment arise? ||16-43||

# 99  
Only when he himself is pure do the mantras stationed in him become perfectly pure;  
then those mantras that have arisen from him, being identical with him, become givers of all accomplishments. ||16-44||

If the ācārya is pure — free from the impurity of the eightfold bodily city beginning with the calm ego, dwelling in the arising of the autonomous, pure consciousness-bliss that is spotless —  
then the mantras that arise from him, resounding with the essence of His potency, become just like him: perfectly pure and givers of all accomplishments.

As taught in the revered Svacchanda-tantra:

# 100  
“Mantras have the form of instruments for the accomplishment of the work of bound souls;  
the ācārya is the cause therein, for he is remembered as having the form of Śiva.” (Svacchanda 3.160)

# 101  
In the Spanda also, beginning “Having taken hold of That” (Spanda-kārikā 2.1)

# 102  
up to “therefore they possess the nature of Śiva.” (2.2) ||16-45||

# 103  
(continuing from the same verse)

# 104  
And from the impulsion of Śiva’s power arises the supreme arising of mantras;  
because they bestow fruit everywhere, therefore they are remembered as Śiva. ||45||  
Therefore all of them, being equal to Śiva, constantly perform grace.

# 105  
The impulsion of Śiva’s power is the reinforcement of the supreme light-bliss;  
from that arises the supreme arising of mantras whose essence is the flashing non-duality of signifier and signified;  
therefore they bestow fruit everywhere.  
Because of this, they are remembered (realised through direct experience) as having the sole form of Śiva.  
“Therefore” — by this very equality with Śiva they constantly perform grace as their very nature.

Establishing that only for an ācārya who knows entry into Śiva are these mantras of the form of Śiva and therefore fruitful, He resumes the topic:

# 106  
And Śiva in the form of the ācārya — therefore they are remembered as bestowers of fruit. ||16-46||

# 107  
The word “form” indicates that one should not think neither of overlordship nor of being overlorded between the Śiva-ācārya and the mantras.  
As taught in the revered Svacchanda-tantra, beginning “I myself am stationed in the maṇḍala here”  
and ending “I myself, stationed in his very body, am the performer of the acts of grace.” ||16-47||

# 108  
Until the mantrī, guru, or even the sādhaka is a knower of reality,  
until then he is not a bestower of fruit — this I tell thee truly, O Goddess. ||47||

# 109  
The sādhaka bestows fruit upon himself; by the particle “api” even the pupil is included.

He strengthens this by stating the opposite:

# 110  
Otherwise, an ācārya united with enjoyment is not a bestower of fruit.

# 111  
Devotion to a body nourished by eating, drinking, and the company of women is nothing but the condition of a bound soul — this is the meaning.

Since this is so,

# 112  
therefore the supreme knower of reality is ever foremost in all rites, ||16-48||

# 113  
in obligatory and all other rites. ||16-49||

# 114

Therefore, whatever being (jantu) has been initiated by him (by such a Guru who possesses this knowledge):

# 115  
Asau  

# 116  
...even Brahma would become Śiva.  

# 117  
He now instructs as to the supreme greatness of this (ritual):  

# 118  
In whichever place one is situated, and whoever performs this rite in the prescribed manner,  
with whatever articles of worship, with whatever difference of devotional attitude,  
whether in the common way, the special way, or the Kaula way, O fair-vowed one —  

# 119  
That very thing he quickly accomplishes, exactly as does the ever-auspicious Lord Sadāśiva.  
Thus, he who, filled with the influx of Śiva (śivāveśa), with the clear knowledge of mantras that arises from that state, performs the Śāmbhava rite and brings about its application through ritual performance (Yāga),  
whoever, according to the appropriateness of worship of the particular chosen deity and according to whatever mode of worship — whether of dual, non-dual, or mixed dual-non-dual nature — and whatever conduct is employed,  
that very person instantly brings about the desired object, exactly like the Lord Sadāśiva.  

# 120  
And for the knower of Reality there is no rule concerning the measurements of the kuṇḍa, maṇḍala, etc. — thus he says:  
Whether square, circular, or even more than a hand’s breadth —  
everything is accomplished by the mere will of the Ācārya through the knowledge of pervasion (vyāpti).  

# 121  
The knowledge of pervasion alone is what makes the Ācārya the means of all attainments.  
He now shows that pervasion even in brief:  

# 122  
Through meditative realization of pervasion by means of the coiled one (Kuṇḍalinī) in the form of the Power of Activity (kriyāśakti),  
knowing that very kuṇḍa to be all-pervading, the Guru becomes omniscient.  

# 123  
By means of the pervasion of the upward-risen Kuṇḍalinī that consists of his own Power of Activity, knowing the kuṇḍa to be all-pervading, the Master who is filled with the influx of Śiva becomes, through initiation and so forth, the bestower of both enjoyment and liberation.  

That it is precisely the knowledge of pervasion that bestows the fruit — this he teaches both negatively and positively:  

# 124  
As long as one does not realize the pervasion of the kuṇḍa, of oneself,  
of the object-to-be-accomplished, of the bound soul (paśu), of the bonds (pāśa), and of the six paths (ṣaḍadhvan),  
he merely plays like a child — how could the desired aim ever be accomplished for him?  
But he who knows himself to be of the nature of Śiva-Śakti,  
he is the best, the giver of all fruits, the doer, the all-pervading auspicious Śiva.  

# 125  
Here, the pervasion of the kuṇḍa consists of the upward-risen Kuṇḍalinī-Śakti;  
the pervasion of the Self is that which abides together with Paraśiva;  
the pervasion of the object-to-be-accomplished (sādhya), i.e. of the chosen deity and mantra, is the essence consisting of the virile energy of the flashing forth of the Supreme Power.  
As for the bound soul (paśu), however —  

# 126  
“arising from the mass of phonemes” (Spanda-kārikā 3.13)

# 127  
— according to that principle, its contracted state of being Śiva is grasped;  
its pervasion consists in the extreme contraction of the divine powers of will, knowledge, and activity — the contraction that belongs to the āṇava, māyīya, and karma impurities, to the imperfect sense of “I” that takes the knowable to be separate, to auspicious and inauspicious impressions, and to the three guṇas sattva, rajas, and tamas.  

# 128  
As it is said:  
“Loss of freedom for cognition and loss of cognition for freedom —  
this twofold āṇava impurity arises from the concealment of one’s own true nature.” (ĪPK 3.2.4)  

# 129  
And:  
“The Māyā impurity, consisting in manifestation of the knowable as separate, gives birth and experience;  
while the karma impurity in the agent consists in lack of awareness…” (ĪPK 3.2.5)  

# 130  
And:  
“That knowledge and activity of the Lord which exist in entities of His own form  
become, in the third (i.e. in Māyā), the sattva, rajas, and tamas for the bound soul.” (ĪPK 3.2.3)  

# 131  
— thus in the Pratyabhijñā. Also in the Spanda:  

# 132  
“of one incapable of purifying the will” (SpK 1.9)  

# 133  
and so on.  
As for the six paths known as varṇa, mantra, pada, kalā, tattva, and bhuvana, their pervasion consists in the reality of the expansion of the Power of Activity in the form of the appearing of signifier and signified that abide in the subtle and gross states of the supreme.  
Therein, the varṇas reflect on the universe as non-different;  
the mantras as both different and non-different;  
the padas as different.  
Each preceding path is here the pervader with respect to the following one;  
each following path is the pervaded, contained within the preceding one.  
Thus everything exists everywhere.  
For this very reason, the purification of each single path that has internalized the other five is enjoined in the respective scriptures.  
Thus it is stated in the venerable Svacchanda-tantra:  

# 134  
“The bhuvanas pervade the tattvas from Ananta up to Śiva;  
the thirty-six (tattvas) consisting of mantra, varṇa, and pada are the pervaders.  
All of them are contained within the tattvas through the union of signified and signifier;  
they are remembered as Nivṛtti and the rest, contained within the kalās.” (SvT 4.95–97)  

# 135  
This has been conclusively established by us in the commentary on that text.  
In the same way, the pervasion in maṇḍalas and elsewhere that which culminates in the essence of non-difference from the Supreme Lord has been extensively demonstrated in that very commentary.  
Therefore:  

# 136  
“I myself am stationed in the maṇḍala…”  

# 137  
and so on — thus has the God of gods extensively taught in the Svacchanda and elsewhere. Enough of this.  
“Work” means enjoyment, liberation, and so forth.  
He, however, who knows himself — together with mantra and all else included by the particle ca — to be Śiva, consisting solely of the light of manifestation,  
and who knows the Power that manifests in differentiated form, exactly like a city in a mirror, through just that freedom of Śiva —  
he, in the form of Śiva who is omniscient and omnipotent through non-difference, is the best and bestows enjoyment and liberation.  
This was stated earlier:  

# 138  
“in entities that are other” (THA 8.18)  

# 139  
and so on. Also in the venerable Triśirobhairava:  
“The individual soul is the Power of Śiva; though present everywhere,  
having ascended to awareness of its true nature, it becomes Śiva through the opening of knowledge.”  

Thus verse 56 (of the Tantrāloka, chapter 16).  

The fire, consisting of the Power of Knowledge, belonging to the previously described kuṇḍa that consists of the Power of Activity,  
together with the distinction of pervaded and pervader, must be known by the Ācārya.  

And such an Ācārya:  

# 140  
He is the knower, the doer of all, the bestower of liberation, the Guru who grants the fruit. (verse 56)  

# 141  
The knower = the knower of Reality.  
The doer of all = whose nature is the expansion of the Supreme Power.  
The one who grants the fruit = the bestower of siddhis. (Āhnika 16.57)  

Moreover:  

# 142  
The Master who performs the sacrifice that transcends the six paths  
becomes a boat on the ocean of Māyā, the auspicious Śiva who saves all. (verse 57)  

# 143  
The sacrifice that transcends the six paths is the supremely blissful consciousness that is Paraśiva Himself;  
the Master who worships Him as the object of worship becomes, like a boat on the ocean of Māyā, the auspicious form that saves everyone. (Āhnika 16.58)  

But he who, without knowing the pervasion taught above,  

# 144  
performs the sacrifice situated within the paths without proper reflection —  
he is incapable of liberating even himself, let alone the Supreme Self. (verse 58)  

# 145  
“Sacrifice” means worship, fire-offering, etc.  
“Situated within the paths” means considering everything — the object of worship, the place of worship, the articles of worship, the worshipper, etc. — to be full of differentiation, without reflection on Reality.  
“Even himself” — the word “even” (vā) emphasizes the latter case. (Āhnika 16.59)  

And this very (topic)

# 146  
Neither does he attain siddhi, nor is he capable of effecting the (ritual) action.

# 147  
On the contrary, for one who, owing to the state of a differentiated knower (bheda-pramātṛ-tayā), harbours the ego-notion that the body etc. is the Self,

# 148  
bondage itself, through those very six paths (ṣaḍadhvan), is remembered as mala (impurity). || 59 ||

# 149  
“Through that very (tenaiva)” means through that (mala) which is not recognised as identical with the supreme Śiva (paramaśivatayā aparijñātena). || 16-60 ||  
And for such a person,

# 150  
one should abandon the māyīya and karma malas as causes of bondage.

# 151  
“Abandon” (visaret) means, on the contrary, one should especially “flow forth” or “expand” (viśeṣeṇa saret, prasaret).

Thus, such a one

# 152  
—who is a paśu (bound soul)—is not at all established there (in the Self); the guru is capable of liberating (him). || 60 ||

# 153  
“Established there” (tatrasthaḥ) means situated in the midst of the paths (adhva-madhya-gataḥ). “Guru” is merely a name; or else, because he consists of body etc., he is a burden (bhāra-bhūtaḥ). || 16-61 ||  
And this is fitting,

# 154  
for the nooses (pāśāḥ) that are situated in the midst of the paths sprout forth from the pure Self.

# 155  
(From the Self) of one who, owing to being situated in the midst of the paths, imagines differentiation.

Therefore, by the method of the teaching that has been stated,

# 156  
having known the Self as the supreme that transcends those (paths), who would not be liberated from bondage? || 61 ||  
Who would not become a bestower of liberation? Who would not attain siddhi?  
Who would not become a giver, O beloved? Who would not be capable in action? || 16-62 ||

# 157  
“That which transcends those (paths)” (tad-atītam) means that which transcends the paths, the form that is solely the supreme Śiva. “Giver” (dātā) means of siddhi to sādhakas. “In action” (kārye) means in protection, increase, etc.

Therefore,

# 158  
he who knows that supreme all-pervading Rudra becomes filled with Him (tanmayaḥ).

# 159  
“He who” (yaḥ) means the extraordinary one; “supreme” (paraḥ) means the unexcelled (Anuttara); “Rudra” because He melts away all afflictions. “Knows” (jñātvā) means recognising (pratyabhijñāya) as the very form of one’s own Self.

But he who does not know the reality

# 160  
knows only measurement, excess-measurement, proportion, etc.—he who is a guru of the paths. || 16-63 ||  
He becomes skilled like a craftsman, a maker of manifold forms.  
He does not become a bestower of liberation, nor does he grant the fruit of siddhi. || 16-64 ||

# 161  
Measurement, excess-measurement, proportion (māna-unmāna-pramāṇa) refer to the upward extent of enclosure; by the word “etc.” is included the sequence of higher and lower among the tattvas etc. “Maker of manifold forms” means one who merely arranges various configurations—he is not one who knows pervasion (vyāpti-jña).

Since ignorant gurus are thus to be avoided,

# 162  
therefore all (gurus) who know reality are to be regarded as equal to Śiva.

# 163  
That is, as established in samādhi that is Śiva.

Although

# 164  
the ācārya is remembered as threefold: the karmī, the yogī, and the jñānī, || 65 ||

# 165  
there in that scripture, || 16-66 ||

nevertheless

# 166  
karma and yoga, O Goddess, have knowledge as their root and bestow fruit.  
No separate distinction is seen between yoga and karma on the one hand and knowledge on the other. || 66 ||

# 167  
Because action and the yoga whose fruit is its special result consist in the expansion of the energy of knowledge, there exists no distinction separate from knowledge; rather, they appear differentiated only as reflections within the mirror of knowledge.

Since this is so,

# 168  
therefore the chief ācārya is the one possessed of knowledge—he bestows everything.

# 169  
The one who is possessed of knowledge—perpetually united with the glorious knowledge that consists in immersion in the supreme consciousness—is the chief ācārya among the ācāryas who are chiefly devoted to karma, yoga, etc. He alone bestows everything. Thus it is said in the venerable Kāmikā:

# 170  
“The guru whose root is knowledge is declared to be the initiator of the seven-session rite.”

# 171  
And in the venerable Siddhānta: “Through knowledge alone one becomes here a great siddha, a lord of yogīs.”

Precisely because he possesses knowledge,

# 172  
he has Śiva as his support; abiding in Śiva, impelled by Śiva’s energy, || 67 ||  
he creates the entire universe, for he is remembered as having the form of Śiva.

# 173  
Śiva is his support—he is to be resorted to as the foundation-wall. Therefore, impelled by Śiva’s energy, he is set in motion in actions such as bestowing grace. Yet, in accordance with the rule “In relation to Śambhu one must exercise vigilance” (Vi.Bhai. 106), he abides in Śiva, the abode of supreme consciousness, supported by the energy, possessed of immersion in That. Therefore, being of the nature of Śiva, he creates the universe—he manifests the universe consisting of the fivefold objects beginning with sound in the states of closing and opening the eyes, both with differentiation and without differentiation, through the flavour of consciousness that never dissolves.

This very one

# 174  
is skilled in the union of icchā, jñāna, and kriyā with Śiva’s energies. || 16-68 ||

# 175  
Union with the energies of icchā, jñāna, and kriyā is the virility belonging to Śiva and Śakti whose nature is light and bliss; he is skilled therein, consisting of immersion in Them. || 16-69 ||

The initiation-rite performed by one who is thus

# 176  
is done by him who, from the will of Śiva, knowing the situation within the paths,

# 177  
—having known, through the expansion of the energy of action in the manner previously described, the paths that are to be pervaded—performs it through the will belonging to his own Self which is Śiva.

For him who belongs to such a one

# 178  
the inconceivable energy of mantra, arisen from the mouth of the Supreme Lord, || 69 ||  
whatever the knower brings about, relying on the energy of Śiva,

# 179  
the mouth of the Supreme Lord is the supreme energy. || 16-70 ||

And this inconceivable energy of mantra

# 180  
accomplishes for him all those respective results through the power of Śiva’s energy. || 70 ||

# 181  
For him the mantras become face-to-face, producing visible conviction.  
Explaining the word “visible” (dṛṣṭa):

the rites of pacification etc. in cases of poison, bhūtas, grahas, etc. || 16-71 ||

# 182  
in an instant he accomplishes everything...

# 183  
The rites of pacification etc. and those concerning poison etc., which render them non-poisonous etc., are to be connected thus.

Objection: If he has capacity to accomplish, why is it said “through the power of Śiva’s energy”?  
Anticipating this doubt and declaring that That alone is the root cause everywhere,

# 184  
...Śiva is the supreme cause.

# 185  
He alone, entered into this or that plane, accomplishes this or that. As said in the venerable Śrīkaṇṭhī:  
“Everything proceeds from the Lord and returns to the Lord.”

Therefore,

# 186  
he who awakens (the disciple), endowed with the strength of knowledge and yoga, || 72 ||  
through the power of the energy of mantra, O beloved, should initiate the candidates for initiation.

# 187  
He awakens—makes directly manifest—the concealed true nature within his own Self, the mass of consciousness that submerges and emerges in body etc., endowed with the fully matured strength of knowledge and yoga. Therefore, through the majesty of the essence of virility, he verily initiates the candidates for initiation.

Explaining this very matter clearly through the etymology of dīkṣā:

# 188  
he causes the nooses to perish and verily bestows the supreme abode. || 16-73 ||  
He is capable of uniting through union, through the power of Śiva’s energy.

# 189  
Because, through the power of the aforesaid energy of Śiva, he is capable of uniting the disciple—by the sequence of the yojanikā taught in the venerable Svacchanda etc.—in the oneness of the supreme and non-supreme abodes; therefore it is rightly said that he alone is fit to perform the initiation that consists in destroying the nooses and bestowing the supreme abode which is the Self of Śiva.

Declaring that he alone is effective in all rites of all streams:

# 190  
visible conviction arises for him, not for any other. || 16-74 ||  
In the Gāruḍa, in the Mātṛtantra, in the left stream, in the right,  
in the Jyeṣṭha, in the Caṇḍāsidharā—action bestows fruit visibly. || 16-75 ||

# 191  
Because for him there arises here in this life visible conviction that is direct realisation consisting in immersion in Śiva—therefore in the Gāruḍa (eastern), in the Mātṛtantra etc. (western), in the system of Jaya etc. (left), in the Bhairava scripture (right), in the Caṇḍāsidharā etc. (uppermost Jyeṣṭha), and in the secret stream of the Mata-kula etc.—everywhere his action, consisting in pacification of poison and bhūtas, bestowal of union, grace of manifold kinds, etc., bestows fruit visibly and immediately—such is the meaning. || 16-76 ||

For this initiation

# 192  
bestows liberation even on this extremely impure man pierced by Māyā,  
attached to enjoyment through karma, and filled with desires. || 76 ||  
That initiation called kriyā, possessing the form of knowledge,

# 193  
Extreme impurity is declared by the two—Māyā and karma—i.e., the māyīya and karma malas; likewise

# 194  
“Desire here is impurity” (Svacchanda 4.105)

# 195  
according to the view of the venerable Svacchanda, it is made clear by the words “filled with desires” that he is pierced by the āṇava mala. “Called kriyā” means that which is named kriyā; in reality it possesses the form of knowledge. Thus the ācārya must rest in both knowledge and action. As said elsewhere:

# 196  
Knowledge devoid of action and action devoid of knowledge—  
the ācārya accomplished through action and knowledge destroys the nooses of the bound soul.

# 197  

Even the action of offerings etc. possesses an inner energy that is great awareness in the form of life. Thus he says:

# 198  
Unmanā, however, is the supreme energy, knowledge-form, transcending limitation. || 77 ||  
That is called kriyā; kriyā is not that which is situated in the midst of the paths.  
“Supreme” means whose nature is unobscured throbbing. “Knowledge-form” because it is said in the venerable Svacchanda: “Therefore that is the supreme vidyā” (4.395). “Transcending limitation” means in which trembling is shaken off—i.e., eternally arisen. That is kriyā. As said in the venerable Pratyabhijñā:

# 199   
…is called Vidyā (4–395).  

Thus it is stated in the venerable Svacchanda Tantra.  

“She whose very nature is Avadhūtikā” means:  
she in whom the state of being “shaken-free” (ava-dhūta) and “ever-trembling” (kampamāna) is perpetual;  
in other words, she is the eternal, never-setting vibration (nityodita-Spanda).  
That very vibration is the Kriyā-Śakti herself.  

As has been declared in the honoured Īśvara-Pratyabhijñā:

# 200  
“Thus the will alone to remain as the world consisting in the appearance of pots, cloths, etc., is causality, agency, action.” (2.4.21)

# 201  

“That which is situated in the midst of the paths” means devoid of pervasion by the energy of action that is great awareness—empty rituals of worship, homa, etc.

And just as ritual worship whose essence is pervasion by the energy of action has been described, so too yoga and knowledge consist solely in that pervasion. Thus he says:

# 202  
The energy of yoga and the energy of knowledge are celebrated in all scriptures. || 16-78 ||

# 203  
That energy of the Supreme Lord Śiva removes the un-Śiva (aśiva).

As said in the venerable Gama scripture:

# 204  
“Yoga is none other, action is none other—that cognition which has ascended to reality,  
in the pacification of the impressions of one’s own mind, is called action.”

# 205  

Since that (energy) belongs to Śiva, therefore

# 206  
it causes bondage and liberation for men; it is not independent by nature. || 16-79 ||

# 207  
Because the energy depends on the nature of the possessor of energy. || 16-80 ||

# 208  
By this very reasoning, Śiva bestows everything auspicious.

# 209  
As said in the Vijnāna-Bhairava:

# 210  
“Because non-difference between energy and possessor of energy is established,  
therefore, owing to the property and the possessor of the property, the supreme energy belongs to the supreme Self.” (18)

# 211  

Not only are knowledge, yoga, and action consisting in non-difference of Śiva and His energy,

but also

# 212  
the lineage of gurus beginning with Śiva—countless millions of Rudras— || 80 ||  
established in succession merely through the teaching of the realised.

# 213  
The lineage of gurus whose beginning is Śiva, the Lord who depends on no other, in the forms of Sadāśiva, Īśvara, Ananta, Śrīkaṇṭha, etc.; those countless millions of Rudras that are the multitudes of mantras presided over by innumerable lords—all of them are established through the teaching of the realised Supreme Śiva, which is the instruction given in the proximity of his own Self.

# 214  
By what inner discipline, by what action,  
have they become perfectly established in their own true Self?  

# 215  
It is solely through the arising-flash of the Supreme Power that comes from the oral instruction of one who has himself attained it — thus he declares:

# 216  
Knowledge of Śiva, O Goddess, is ever remembered as the tradition of the realised. || 16-81 ||

# 217  
Knowledge of Śiva is immersion in the energy of Rudra. “Because” is causal. Thereby the meaning of the previous verse is justified. || 16-82 ||

Not only is the lineage of gurus beginning with Śiva consisting of Śiva’s energy,

but also

# 218  
from Brahmā down to a blade of grass—everything is endowed with Śiva’s energy.

# 219  
Properly endowed with Śiva’s energy, consisting of non-difference with Him. As said in the Śiva-sūtras:

# 220  
“The universe is the expansion of His energy.” (3.30)

# 221  

Concluding this and making it clear:

# 222  
Thus the entire universe, moving and unmoving, consists of energy. || 82 ||

# 223  
From the unanchored down to the initiated, everything consists solely of Śiva’s energy. The classes of mantra, mantreśvara, etc., consist of the expanding energy of Śiva; from Vijñānākala down to plants consist of the contracting energy of Śiva—such is the division. || 83 ||

Therefore,

# 224  
the possessor of energy accomplishes all actions—there is no doubt herein.

# 225  
The class of mantra, ācārya, etc., possessed of immersion in Śiva’s energy, is capable of accomplishing respective actions.

But others

# 226  
devoid of energy do not succeed even with hundreds of millions of yāgas, || 16-83 ||  
even with billions of japa and hundreds of thousands of homas performed elaborately.

# 227  
Mantra-ācāryas.

Since this is so,

# 228  
therefore with all effort one should practise knowledge of Śiva. || 16-84 ||  
Then all actions without exception succeed; otherwise, never.

# 229  
The particle eva is to be connected after the word na.

And when one possessed of practised knowledge of Śiva

# 230  
performs rites of pacification etc., then he is guru. || 16-85 ||

# 231

Moreover,

# 232  
in Yāga, homa, japa, and likewise in the procedure of drawing etc.,

# 233  
he alone is authorised.

Thus,

# 234  
having announced “I shall now declare the Yāga” (16.26),

# 235  
having described the concealment of the Yāga-house, the true nature of the guru who knows pervasion and is possessed of immersion in the energy of Rudra, and the essence of the virility of the supreme energy of the universe from mantra down to plants,

the Yāga that is the support of the worship of the Lord that was announced

# 236  
—if calamities have arisen, one should commence the previously described Yāga. || 16-86 ||

# 237  
One should commence the maṇḍala of the previously announced form, divided into four doors etc., for the worship of the Lord. || 16-87 ||

Therein,

# 238  
having considered the object to be accomplished and the substance for it, collected with materials,

# 239  
having considered the auspicious object to be accomplished—consisting of materials such as pollen, sandal, saffron, incense etc.—with the intention of the highest good,

the Yāga consisting in worship and homa of the venerable Amṛteśa etc.

# 240  
is performed for whichever...

# 241  
object to be accomplished,

# 242  
...pacification of that arises. || 87 ||

# 243  
Calamities perish. || 16-88 ||

Moreover,

# 244  
Sesame, milk, together with ghee and white sugar—  
offering in fire with whose name...

# 245  
that object to be accomplished

# 246  
...attains pacification of fever.

# 247  
With samidh of milk-producing trees, anointed with milk, concentrated—  
offering in fire with whose name...

# 248  
...pacification of that arises certainly. || 16-89 ||

With flowers mixed with ghee, offering with whose name—  
pacification of that arises quickly; herein no deliberation is to be made. || 16-90 ||

# 249  
Desiring prosperity, having offered Śrī-phala, the sādhaka attains abundant wealth.

# 250  
By homa of ghee and guggulu, lasting nourishment arises. || 91 ||

# 251  
Performed by the ācārya for the object to be accomplished. || 16-92 ||

# 252  
Having made the saṃpuṭa of Mṛtyujit, if one recites the name of the object to be accomplished,  
whether for oneself or for another, death does not afflict that one. || 92 ||

# 253  
With the mantra of the object to be accomplished, for the one to be protected, whether oneself or another—such is the meaning. || 16-93 ||

# 254  
Then on an eight-petalled lotus, one should place (the name) in the pericarp.  
The name enclosed by the letters of the object to be accomplished—above it place Mṛtyujit. || 93 ||

One should arrange the aṅgas in the petals according to the division beginning with Āgneya etc.  
One should draw outside it the lotus complete with twice eight petals. || 16-94 ||

Then fill from the east etc. with the sixteen kalās.  
One should place outside it the lotus endowed with thirty-two petals. || 16-95 ||

According to the order from kādi to mānta, from the east etc., ending with īśa.

# 255  
“Arises” is to be written. The aṅgas are those taught in the second chapter: in the directions agni, īśa, rakṣās, marut, and the intermediate quarters. The four beginning with heart in the four groups of directions beginning with east; astramantra in the pericarp before the Lord; locana (in the centre)—such is the division. “That lotus” is a compound meaning “the lotus of that.” “Ending with īśa” means up to the four petals in the īśa direction.

And these

# 256  
all the letters enclosed by the letters of the object to be accomplished are situated in the three circles. || 16-96 ||

# 257  
In the three circles means in the three groups of petals. Enclosure by the letters of the object to be accomplished is as before. || 16-97 ||

And of these letters of the petals

# 258  
in the middle of all of them one should enclose the name of the object to be accomplished alone.

# 259  
Enclosure means placing within the saṃpuṭa of the letters of the object to be accomplished.

Explaining the special feature of the name placed in the saṃpuṭa of the mantra in the pericarp:

# 260  
One should place in the pericarp the name placed in the middle of Jīva. || 97 ||

# 261  
Jīva is the letter sa; place the name within it. || 16-98 ||

# 262  
One should conceive Jīva inside Prāṇa...

# 263  
Prāṇa is the letter ha.

# 264  
...Prāṇa placed in the middle of the letters.

# 265  
Situated ending with kṣa. Therein the rule given elsewhere “placed in the middle of ka” is to be followed.

Having thus drawn the lotus containing two lotuses within,

# 266  
outside it one should make the auspicious circle perfectly complete. || 98 ||

# 267  
One should place the letter ṭha.

# 268  
Outside that, one should make the city of Indra enclosed by vajra-bearing vajras.

# 269  

Thus

# 270  
having drawn this circle on birch-bark, O fair-faced one, || 16-99 ||  
on a very pure, flawless, smooth (bark) with rocanā and saffron

# 271  
mixed with sandal and milk.

Afterwards, the ācārya worshipping this, having made it dust-white with camphor powder,

# 272  
having wrapped it with white thread and new cotton, || 16-100 ||  
having placed this in honey mixed with very fragrant ghee,  
having placed this in an earthen vessel, one should worship with white flowers. || 16-101 ||

With rice-milk mixed with ghee, with various edibles,  
having perfumed with sweet incense, one should worship with abundant materials. || 16-102 ||

# 273  
With abundant materials. || 16-103 ||

And its arrangement is this:

# 274  
Outside, herein, one should then worship eight vessels beginning from the east,  
filled with perfumed water containing sandal, camphor, and excellent incense. || 103 ||

# 275  
Filled with water containing jewels, endowed with all herbs,

# 276  
golden, silver, copper, or of beautiful clay. || 16-104 ||  
Rootless at the wrong time, very auspicious, excellent, endowed with marks.  
In their middle one should worship in order the guardians of the worlds. || 16-105 ||

# 277  
“Rootless” means those whose root is not below. “Worship” with Praṇava, name, and namaḥ. || 16-106 ||

# 278  
To them the command of Śiva is to be given: “Protect the excellent object to be accomplished.”

# 279  
By saying “excellent,” he teaches that the rule herein is not to be applied in the case of an inferior object.

Then

# 280  
in the morning, at midday, in the evening, and at midnight, one should then worship. || 106 ||

# 281  
For whomever it is thus performed by name, that man

# 282  
after seven nights have passed becomes conqueror of death,  
freed from all diseases, devoid of all faults. || 16-107 ||  
He is released from all illnesses, from all fevers—there is no doubt.  
Freed from all suffering, devoid of calamities, || 16-108 ||  
that man remains again like a snake that has cast off its skin.

# 283  
Diseases are those of the belly etc.; illnesses are boils etc.

Moreover, in the worship of this circle

# 284  
if the sādhaka, O Goddess, undistracted and devoted to it, || 16-109 ||

# 285  
devoted to japa and homa, calm, remains in that place,

# 286  
possessed of being, endowed with virility, filled with compassion and generosity, || 16-110 ||  
after seven nights have passed, he can even bring back the dead by force.

# 287  
He can even revive the dead. “Endowed with virility” means the sādhaka who knows the virility of the mantra, or the mantra-siddha ācārya.

And one who is thus

# 288  
is to be worshipped with cows, land, gold, cloth, etc., with armlets, bracelets, etc., || 16-111 ||  
with supreme devotion, especially for pacification and nourishment.  
Because the daiśika is verily mantra-made, verily Śiva manifest. || 16-112 ||  
Therefore, merely by being worshipped, all (mantras) become givers of the fruits of siddhi  
without fail, O auspicious one...

# 289  
“Mantra-made” because, by the previously stated reasoning, he consists of immersion in Śiva. “All” means the mantras worshipped in the circle.

Herein a doubt easily arising for knowers limited by Māyā is to be abandoned—  
this he declares through positive and negative concomitance:

# 290  
...my word is true, not false. || 16-113 ||

# 291  
But if worship of the guru is not performed, then thus it happens—he says:

# 292  
otherwise there would be loss of siddhi, and what was done would be fruitless.  
For the ācārya also and for the object to be accomplished, a rākṣasī destructive of sight, existence, and life arises. || 16-114 ||

# 293  
Whether they be initiates of the samayin or putraka level or sādhakas—through non-worship of the guru, a rākṣasī destructive of sight, existence, and life certainly arises for the ācārya also and for the object to be accomplished—such is the meaning. || 16-115 ||

Since this is so,

# 294  
therefore with all effort the knower of mantra should worship the guru.

# 295  
Thus for him

# 296  
the mantras become worshipped, bestowing all fruits of siddhi. || 115 ||

# 297  
Worship of the guru who knows reality accomplishes the desired—auspiciousness.

# 298  
Even an extremely difficult action that the guru, mantras, etc., accomplish intensely through immersion—  
I resort to that Eye which is Śaṅkara’s.

# 299  
Thus, on the Śrī Netra Tantra,  
in the *Netrodyota* composed by the venerable Kṣemarāja,  
who is supreme among the great Ācāryas devoted to Maheśvara,  
this concludes the sixteenth chapter:
**Various Objects Whereto Worship, etc., of Amriteshvara Lead**
