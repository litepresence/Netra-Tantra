Ninth Chapter
Neṭrodyotaḥ: The Illumination of the Eye

# 2

The Lord whose eyes are pure, self-dependent consciousness,
who bestows wondrous grace,
manifests victoriously in forms beginning with Sadāśiva.

# 3

Now, making the connection with this chapter, the venerable Goddess spoke:

# 4

O God, I have heard from you everything concerning the greatness of the Lord of Mantras.  
Now I wish to hear that which was spoken by the All-Pervading One to me:  
That Lord who, in accordance with the injunctions of all the Āgamas and through differences of inner disposition,  
grants siddhis in the Vāma, dakṣiṇā, Siddhānta, Saura, Vaiṣṇava, and Vedic traditions—  
That Lord who grants the desired siddhi in conformity with the practitioner’s chosen conduct:  
O Lord of the gods, please explain to me that which yields the fruit of the wish-fulfilling gem of thought.

# 5

“All greatness has been declared”—this is stated in the eighth chapter.
“Declared” means in the eighth chapter, beginning with the words “By whatever yoga and whatever difference of inner disposition” (8.56) and ending with “grants siddhis.”
(8.57) The words beginning “Vāma…” serve to introduce the coming chapters on inner dispositions.
The “desired conduct” is the well-known conduct proper to the deities of each respective stream (srotas), not a mixed one. As will be said later:

# 6

“In whichever streams I have taught a particular conduct in the scriptures,
that very conduct must be observed in those streams, especially in worship and homa.” (16.21)

# 7

Thus. Because the arising of fruits such as the Cintāratna (wish-fulfilling gem of thought) comes from this.

9-3

To resolve this matter, the venerable Lord said:

# 8

Listen, O Beautiful One! I shall tell you the highest truth in its essence.

# 9

Concerning the matter you have asked—such is the meaning.

# 10

In regard to this very Lord who is the supreme non-dual reality consisting solely of consciousness,

# 11

He now teaches in due order how He is properly endowed with the nature of the various pictured deities:

# 12

By the Amṛteśa method, I have taught the Conqueror of Death.

# 13

Which, at the beginning of the first chapter,

# 14

Thus the supreme God, the stainless Amṛteśa,
has been designated as the very nature (svabhāva) of the universe—pervading, eternal, immovable.

9-4
In ultimate reality He has neither form nor colour,
for the God is all-pervading, consisting of all the Āgamas, auspicious.

9-5
Pervading all mantras, the bestower of all siddhis.

# 15

This Amṛteśa, the God of great heroism, has been perfectly designated as the very nature of the universe without specification of particulars. He has no form such as Sadāśiva etc., nor even a name that is ultimately real. Rather,

# 16

“He should make himself knowable from himself alone.”

# 17

Thus,

# 18

“Having by freedom liberated himself, by freedom the Lord, whose nature is non-dual,
creates (forms such as) Īśa etc. through acts of will and employs them in worldly transaction.” (1.5.16)

# 19

In accordance with the method taught in the Pratyabhijñā, He manifests thus for the grace of men. And this is fitting, because the God is full of play; He assumes all forms and shines as all forms. Therefore He has the form of all the various scriptures taught to the various disciples who are to be instructed, because all scriptures are essentially one with the Lord’s single form whose nature is supreme reflection (parāmarśa). Hence He is auspicious, consisting of the supreme non-dual bliss.
Only where the supreme Lord does not manifest that supreme reflective awareness (vimarśa), there the disciples who are to be trained by the respective limited scriptures rest in the meanings of intermediate sentences, unaware that the sentences concerning creation etc. are ultimately one with the single supreme sentence.
Therefore, by the reasoning stated, the God consists of all the Āgamas; hence He pervades all mantras without difference and is therefore the bestower of all siddhis.

He makes this clear with an illustration:

# 20

Just as a pure crystal threaded on a string, when coloured red etc.,

9-6
reflects everywhere whatever colour it has taken on,
showing that very colour to others, though not itself coloured by nature,

9-7
so in exactly the same way the Lord of gods, employed in all the Āgamas,
grants fruit in all respects to all practitioners.

9-8

# 21

“Reflects” means it takes on a reflection. “Not by its own nature” because it is uniformly pure. Employed in all the Āgamas because He is the Self of all, meditated upon in the form of the deity taught in each particular Āgama, He grants fruit to all practitioners.

Since this is so,

# 22

Therefore, brilliant like a wish-fulfilling gem in all streams,
meditated upon through differences of inner disposition, He bestows the fruit of all the Āgamas.

9-9
Śiva, Sadāśiva, Bhairava, Tumburu likewise,
in the form of Moon and Sun, the All-Pervading One bearing the form of Fire—

9-10

# 23

Brilliant in all streams, shining forth, meditated upon as Sadāśiva etc. in accordance with the particular disposition of mind that is suitable to each, He grants the fruit taught in the Siddhānta, Vāma, dakṣiṇā and other scriptures.

9-11

That this is reasonable, He declares:

# 24

Because the God consists of knowledge, and knowledge exists in many forms.  
The deliverance of bound beings who are limited—That is called the Eye.


# 25

The God, the supreme Lord, consists of knowledge whose ultimate reality is pure consciousness. And that knowledge exists in many forms: by His freedom He manifests contraction and assumes multiplicity. Therefore, since the God, through the visions and worship of those who participate in the appearance of contraction, delivers them by causing the expansion of their own true nature, He is called “Eye” in the sense explained, not as an eyeball.

12

And this very same (Lord)

# 26

Because He lifts one beyond death, He is called Conqueror of Death;  
thus He bestows immortality and is remembered as Amṛteśa.


# 27

Death is the inert state of body, Prāṇa etc. Immortality is immersion in the energy of Rudra.

13

# 28

Thus the all-pervading God, manifold like a gem,
is worshipped by all, O Goddess, with the desire for the fruit of their own siddhi.

9-13
The God grants fruit to all, fulfilling whatever is prayed for.

# 29

“Thus”—by the method stated. “With the desire for the fruit of their own siddhi” means with intense focus on the fruit that accords with their desire.

9-14

Since this is so,

# 30

Therefore the practitioner who abides in practice in accordance with his inner disposition—

14
by whatever inner disposition he has, by that very disposition the Lord becomes the bestower of its fruit.

# 31

“In accordance with inner disposition” means conforming to the aspirant’s mental state. “Disposition” means the mode of contemplation.

9-15

Thus, in both internal and external worship:

# 32

The practitioner who constantly meditates in the form of Sadāśiva—

15
his body becomes as though the body of Sadāśiva, O Queen of the gods.

# 33

He acquires a body like Sadāśiva’s, assuming a form like Sadāśiva’s for the sake of granting grace.

9-16

That this is fitting, He declares:

# 34

For He is the cause of grace to all—

16

# 35

Therefore, in conformity with the venerable Aghoravaktra, this (Lord)

# 36

Sadyojāta, Vāma, Aghora, Puruṣa, and Īśāna in bodily form—

# 37

must be meditated upon (the rest is supplied).

And because this king of mantras has the form of the supreme non-dual reality and is all-encompassing,

He says that the limbs, seat etc. are to be installed with this very mantra:

# 38

With this (mantra), O Fair-faced One, the heart etc. are to be installed,

9-17
and with this very mantra one should fashion one’s own seat.

# 39

By this special instruction an exception is shown to the previously mentioned limb-mantras. The word “eva” indicates neither less nor more. It is auspicious, abiding in non-dual pervasion; one’s own seat is the seat that extends to Ananta. As was said in the venerable Kālottara:

# 40

“With the supreme energy the seed-syllable germinates; thereafter the seat of Ananta.
One should gradually make Ananta terminate in Ananta, O Six-faced One.”

# 41

And so on.

He teaches the meditation upon the Lord in the form of Sadāśiva:

# 42

Resembling a hundred million moons, like a mass of Himalayan snow,

9-18
five-faced, with wide eyes, ten-armed, possessing three eyes,
wearing a sacred thread of serpents, clad in a tiger-skin,

9-19
seated in lotus posture upon a successful lotus.

# 43

One should meditate upon the God.

Moreover, for Him:

# 44

Trident, lotus, arrow, rosary, club—

9-20
thus in the right hands; listen to the supreme (weapons) in the left:
spheṭaka, mirror, bow, citron, water-pot.

9-21

# 45

Spheṭaka is the uplifter.

Moreover:

# 46

The God bearing the crescent moon on His crest, who has drunk poison—

the face in front (is thus).

# 47

One should meditate.

And for Him:

# 48

The right (face) black, fearful and fierce, with tusks, distorted face,

22
adorned with a garland of skulls, causing terror to the world;
the western face like frost or jasmine; the left face the lustre of red lotuses;

9-23
the upper face, O Great Queen, one should contemplate as crystal-like.

# 49

Clear.

# 50

Having thus meditated upon the Lord of gods, one should worship Him according to rule.

9-24

# 51

The rule is the method taught in the Siddhānta.

9-25

Where should one worship? He declares:

# 52

In one’s own image, on a maṇḍala, in a liṅga, in water, or upon a lotus.

# 53

One’s own image is the principal one taught earlier etc.

And there:

# 54

One should worship Īśāna and the others ending with Sadya in their respective directions.

25

# 55

With the root mantra alone, in the directions beginning with Īśāna etc., one should worship in the order of the enveloping circle of the faces beginning with Īśāna.

9-26

Before Him:

# 56

In the south-east etc. one should install the heart etc. according to the ritual of worship.

# 57

For the sake of the worship ritual: in the south-east, north-east, south-west, and north-west directions the heart, head, tuft, armour; in the four directions beginning with east the weapon; before the God The Eye—thus one should install the limbs. As was said there:

# 58

“One should install the heart in the south-east, the head likewise in the north-east,
the tuft in the south-west, the armour in the north-west;
having installed the weapon in the directions, (one installs) Sadāśiva in the pericarp.” (Kālottara 7.7-8)

# 59

Thus. Because The Eye has the form of light and is primary, its place is at the tip of the pericarp. As said in the venerable Svacchanda:

# 60

“The Eye, resembling a blaze of light, abides in the middle.” (Svacch. 2.111)

# 61

Thus.

When someone worships in this manner,

# 62

then without doubt he succeeds—I tell you truly.

26

# 63

The class of worshippers—thus auspiciousness.

# 64

Assuming the form of Sadāśiva for the sake of supreme grace,
the Conqueror of Death triumphs—the auspicious non-dual Eye that bears the mark of Śaṅkara.

# 65

Thus, on the Śrī Netra Tantra,  
in the *Netrodyota* composed by the venerable Kṣemarāja,  
who is supreme among the great Ācāryas devoted to Maheśvara,  
this concludes the ninth chapter:
**Some Forms of the Deity**
