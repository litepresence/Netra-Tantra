Fifth Chapter
Neṭrodyotaḥ: The Illumination of the Eye

# 2

That which anoints with the supreme nectar-streams
flowing from His own body for the sake of enjoyment and liberation—
we worship with supreme devotion this Eye of the auspicious pair of Śiva and Śivā.

# 3

Now, in order to consecrate (abhiṣeka) both the Ācāryas who possess good conduct, learning, and character, and the Sādhakas who have already received the seeded initiation (sabījā dīkṣā) etc. indicated in this scripture and spoken of in other scriptures, the glorious Lord said:
“I shall now declare the rite of consecration—how (yathā) it is to be performed, and for whom (yasya) it is given here.”
“Yathā” means “in what manner the actions are to be carried out”; “yasya” means “for the Ācārya or for the Sādhaka it is bestowed.” Thus He promises: “I shall teach the consecration of such a person accordingly.”

Thereupon:

# 4

The Ācārya is to be consecrated with eight vessels according to the prescribed rule. || 4 ||

# 5

The prescribed rule (vidhāna) is as follows:
The candidate, seated in the north-east (Īśāna) direction upon a seat of sacred leaves etc. placed within a maṇḍala beginning with a svastika, having performed the prescribed nyāsas, worshipped as Amṛteśa, the vessels filled with gold, boiled rice, earth, cow-dung, darbha grass, white mustard, and so forth, the lamps blazing, all obstacles having been dispelled by rebuke, and, together with contemplation of the supreme mantra expanding and causing the flowing of the stream of supreme nectar, the water of the vessels is poured upon his head. || 5-1 ||

Those very vessels are declared to be the Vidyēśvaras and the oceans containing wombs (sagarbhaga).
One must meditate upon them as filled with the water of the eight oceans, pervaded by the expansion of the glorious Amṛteśa-Bhairava, and presided over by Ananta and the other Vidyēśvaras.
“Sagarbhaga” means containing jewels, herbs, unbroken grains, and so forth. This is only illustrative; therefore, with the mantras proper to each, they are to be charged individually with 108 repetitions of the root mantra.

In the Āgamic rite of consecration, everything taught in the scriptures must be followed: the bestowal of the turban that reveals the means of expansion in knowledge and yoga, the Saṃhitā, the umbrella, sandals, the knife, the scissors, and so on.

Another option concerning the vessels is stated:

# 6

Or with five, the number of the elements, or with three that embody the tattvas, || 1 ||

# 7

Or even with a single one that is Śiva Himself, named Ātman, Vidyā, and Śiva.

Those whose full manifestation comes through proper contemplation of the elements—from earth up to the ether—by tracing the pervasion of the kalās beginning with Nivṛtti; those whose form is represented by the tattvas beginning with Ātman; those whose complete manifestation is through Ātman, Vidyā, and Śiva, meaning they are fully manifested by becoming identical with That. || 5-2 ||

This consecration is performed:

# 8

For the Ācārya to obtain authority, and for the Sādhaka who desires siddhi. || 2 ||

# 9

In the case of the Ācārya, it is to be performed solely for the purpose of grace toward others; in the case of the Sādhaka, with the intention that perfection concerning his own self may arise through worship of the mantra. Even here, all the procedures taught in the venerable Svacchanda Tantra and other sources are to be followed. || 5-3 ||

Now, this Sādhaka:

# 10

Once consecrated and authorised, should undertake the practice of the mantra.

# 11

He must not remain indifferent.

Therefore he should be:

# 12

Observing the vows of that (mantra), following its prescribed conduct, devoted to it, wholly given to it, || 3 ||
delighting in pure food, eating lightly, with senses controlled,
in a solitary place, in a sacred field, within the range of a tīrtha or temple,
his mind detached from all associations—the Sādhaka should begin japa. || 5-4 ||

# 13

There (among these qualities), the vow is restraint of speech and mind; the prescribed conduct is that which consists of worship and homa. The rest is clear. || 5-5 ||

In that context:

# 14

The mantrin, endowed with prior service, should perform one lakh (100,000) repetitions. || 5 ||
Thereby the ordinary rites become perfected for the Sādhaka.

# 15

Regarding prior service, the venerable Svacchanda Tantra states that japa is to be performed from the rising of the Pisces constellation onward with increased rest, and that homa is to be performed with one-tenth of the japa using substances of the highest, middling, or lowest grade.
“Ordinary rites” means subjugation, attraction, and so forth. || 5-6 ||

Furthermore:

# 16

By ten lakh (1,000,000) repetitions he attains earthly siddhi,

# 17

and gains the power of movement through the nether worlds and the sky.

# 18

By fifty lakh (5,000,000) repetitions, without doubt,  
the Sādhaka attains divine siddhi. || 5-7 ||


# 19

“Divine” means attainment of lordship over worlds.

# 20

Likewise, by a crore (10,000,000) repetitions of the japa he attains the Īśvarī siddhi.
Becoming all-pervading Śiva, capable of both restraint and grace, || 5-8 ||
he does everything exactly as he wishes, sustains intensely, withdraws,
goes everywhere, is the doer of all, and certainly becomes all-knowing. || 5-9 ||

# 21

By “all-pervading” and the rest, the Īśvarī siddhi is clearly explained. “Everywhere-going” means having all as his Self.
And the Sādhaka attains all this while still in this very body. Thus auspiciousness.

# 22

With the bodies of Brahmā (born of the lotus), Viṣṇu (dark-hued), and Rudra, separately,
and again with the auspicious forms of Śiva and the most auspicious Lord, yet not separately, He spreads forth everything.
That Eye of the auspicious pair of Śiva and Śivā which here anoints the devoted with supreme nectar—
victory to it, bestower of all perfections!

# 23

Thus, on the Śrī Netra Tantra,  
in the *Netrodyota* composed by the venerable Kṣemarāja,  
who is supreme among the great Ācāryas devoted to Maheśvara,  
this concludes the fifth chapter:
**The Anointing Ceremony**
