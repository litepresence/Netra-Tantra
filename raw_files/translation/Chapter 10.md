Tenth Chapter
Neṭrodyotaḥ: The Illumination of the Eye

# 2

Victorious is the third Eye of Śaṅkara — that southern form of the body,
Skilful in binding with the heap of nooses, fierce (Aghora) yet never ineffective (amogha),
The terrifying Bhairava resorted to for the sake of grace!

# 3

To establish that the Lord Himself is of the very essence of Bhairava as previously declared, the glorious Lord spoke:

# 4

Now I shall declare the distinction of the Bhairava teaching:
Like a mass of collyrium broken asunder, embodying the fire of the world-dissolution. || 9 ||

Five-faced, mounted upon a corpse, ten-armed, frightful,
Resembling a host of night-faces, roaring with a terrifying sound. || 10-1 ||

His face grim with fangs, eyes fierce with knitted brows,
Seated upon the throne of a lion, adorned with garlands of serpents. || 10-2 ||

Wearing a garland of skulls as ornament, his mouth gaping wide, of immense body,
Wrapped in an elephant’s hide as garment, the moon placed as his crest. || 10-3 ||

Holding a skull-bowl and skull-staff, bearing sword and shield,
The God who bears noose and goad, whose hands grant boons and dispel fear. || 10-4 ||

His hand brandishing the thunderbolt, the great hero holding battle-axe in hand —
Having worshipped Bhairava thus, one should then meditate upon Her who rests in his lap. || 10-5 ||

Resembling the fire of universal destruction, gleaming like lac and vermilion,
Hair standing erect, of immense form, exceedingly terrible and most frightful. || 10-6 ||

With huge belly, five-faced, adorned with three eyes,
Claws for nails, eyes sunken deep, ornamented with a garland of severed heads. || 10-7 ||

The Goddess possessing the arms proclaimed by Bhairava, bearing the weapons of Bhairava,
Known as the Power of Will (Icchāśakti), who freely moves into the lap of Svacchanda. || 10-8 ||

Known as Aghoreśī — meditate upon Her bearing this very form.

# 5

In the Bhairava scriptures that arise from the Southern Current, in such texts as the Svacchanda, Caṇḍa, Triśirobhairava and others, the essential form of the Lord who conquers Death — distinguished by its supremely radiant appearance and taught as the destroyer of all distinctions — I shall now expound. By the words “like a mass of collyrium broken asunder…” (#4) it is declared that He is the destroyer of distinctions through His supremely black and intensely radiant form. Here the “corpse” is Sadāśiva Himself, as stated in the glorious Svacchanda-tantra:

# 6

“One should imagine (the corpse) extending up to Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Maheśa.” (Svacchanda 1.39)

# 7

Thus. “Roaring” refers to the absorption into the primordial sound (nāda). “Gaping” means mouth wide open. “Wrapped in an elephant’s hide” means clothed in that very hide as an outer garment. The sequence beginning “skull-bowl…” indicates the ten arms in savya and apasavya order. “Having worshipped” means with this very mantra, together with the limbs placed at heart etc., and in the posture that will be described hereafter; authority belongs to this very (form) everywhere. “Sunken eyes” means both the inner vision and the outward gaze. By “Power of Will” it is taught that, although possessing form, She is the essence of the all-pervading Supreme. Those powers who have no form that is fierce, differentiated, or predominantly mixed with difference — those Aghorā powers in the form of rays who bestow grace by the expansion of the non-dual supreme abode — their sovereign mistress (īśī) one should meditate upon for worship. Whatever secret concerning the form of Bhairava exists here has been extensively shown by me in the Svacchandoddyota; the same should be understood in other forms as well. The rest is clear.

This very form — Svacchanda-Bhairava whose nature is supreme consciousness together with his consort Bhairavī who is the Power of Will —

# 8

Is proclaimed in all tantras yet kept concealed, not openly revealed. || 10-9 ||

# 9

Even in the Siddhānta scriptures, because of the pervasion of the supreme Lord who is partless, autonomous and all-pervading. || 10-10 ||

Yet because of its extreme esoteric nature there,

# 10

My intention has never been perceived by anyone on earth; it is most rare.
Those whose vision is gross are incapable of touching the secret.

# 11

So also in the glorious Kālottara:

# 12

“That supreme seed which is called ṅa…” (1.5)

# 13

and so on,

# 14

“These five realities by which the entire universe is pervaded…” (8.2),
“Having understood thus, O Mahāsena, one may initiate even dog-cookers.”

# 15

Such extremely secret teaching would be corrupted if interpreted otherwise.

# 16

Having said this by way of digression, He now states the main subject:
For the suppression of diseases, possession, and other sins,  || 10 ||
For the protection of cows and brahmins, and always for peace and nourishment, one should worship.

# 17

“Possession” caused by disease means attack. By the word “etc.” are included spirit-possession and the like. For pacifying those sins, and for protection, peace, and nourishment, one should worship this Bhairava-couple. The locative “in cows and brahmins” is used in the sense of the genitive.

# 18

Alternatively: Radiant like snow, jasmine, moon, and pearl, || 10-11 ||
Resembling ten million moons, like a mountain of crystal.

# 19

One should meditate upon the Bhairava-couple thus.

# 20

Resembling the fire of world-dissolution, like the crimson kiṃśuka flower,
Having the form of ten million suns, or red — meditate upon Him thus.
Or again, ruby-colored, gleaming like yellow orpiment.

# 21

Anticipating the doubt “How can the One assume many forms?”, He says:

# 22

The God who assumes forms according to (the meditator’s) will grants the fruits of all desired powers.

# 23

Consciousness-Bhairava Himself, according to the desire of the particular aspirant who longs for particular accomplishments, by His own will assumes that particular form — this is the meaning.

Therefore:

# 24

In whatever form the sādhaka meditates upon Him, || 10-14 ||
That very auspicious form He assumes which grants the corresponding accomplishment.

# 25

The form beginning “resembling ten million moons” (#18) etc. is not, as previously, mounted upon a corpse, but rather:

# 26

One should meditate upon Him seated in the centre of a lotus and thereafter worship Him according to rule. || 10-15 ||

With offerings, flowers, incense, and wine appropriate to that (form).

# 27

The “rule” comprises the oblation of the nirōdha-arghya etc. As stated in the glorious Svacchanda: “Thereafter the arghya should be offered with fragrant liquor” (2.136) etc. “Appropriate” means in accordance with the meditation. || 10-16 ||

Before the aforementioned Bhairava-couple, in the east, south, west, and north directions respectively, He now enjoins the goddesses Siddhā, Raktā, Śuṣkā, and Utpalahastā:

# 28

The goddess resembling cow’s milk, radiant as a necklace of laughter,
Perfectly pure, like crystal, spotless as jasmine, moon, and camphor.
Four-armed, three-eyed, adorned with a single face, || 10-17 ||
Clad in white garments, ornamented with white necklaces,
Seated upon the antelope throne, immensely powerful, holding the thunderbolt,
Bearing noose and goad, resounding with the ringing of a bell,
Standing in the eastern direction, facing the God of gods. || 10-18–19 ||
The man who, with concentrated mind, meditates upon Her quickly attains success.

# 29

“Moon” means camphor; “antelope” means deer. The eastern direction is that facing the God.

Having described Siddhā, He now describes Raktā:

# 30

Resembling ten million suns, radiant as blazing fire, || 10-20 ||
Like a heap of vermilion, in the form of lightning, terrifying,
Three-eyed, with fearsome face, huge-bellied, of immense body, || 21 ||
Hanging belly, pendulous breasts, mounted upon a corpse, immensely powerful,
Wearing a garland of skulls as ornament, tiger-skin at her hips, || 10-22 ||
Upper garment of elephant-hide, adorned with a garland of severed heads,
Shining like a great meteor, illuminating the quarters, naked,
Four-armed, single-faced, bearing sword and shield,
Holding skull-bowl and skull-staff — meditate upon Her standing in the southern direction. || 10-23–24 ||

# 31

“Naked” implies an alternative reading to “upper garment of elephant-hide.” || 10-25 ||

He now describes Śuṣkā:

# 32

Blackish-red, supremely radiant, fleshless, deformed of face,
Utterly withered, with sunken eyes, single-faced, four-armed, || 25 ||
Three-eyed, fearsome-faced, adorned with serpent garlands,
Hair standing erect, of immense form, wearing a garland of severed heads, || 10-26 ||
Her limbs bound with tendons and sinews, loins covered with human skin,
Clad in tiger-skin, bearing sword and shield,
Holding in her hand a pouch filled with entrails, blood, and flesh,
Gnashing great intestines — meditate upon Her in the western direction, || 10-27–28 ||

# 33

Seated upon the throne of a crocodile, facing the God of gods.
Because of her extreme dryness, her limbs are bound only with tendons and sinews. “Pouch” refers to a specific kind of vessel.

The crocodile that is mentioned as her throne is now described:

# 34

Camel-necked, elephant-shouldered, horse-eared, ram-faced, || 10-29 ||
Legs resembling a tiger’s, claws like the thunderbolt weapon,
Back like a tortoise, tail like a fish — thus is the crocodile declared. || 10-30 ||

# 35

Whose face is like that of a ram (huḍa). Whose claws resemble the vajra weapon. || 31 ||

He now describes Utpalahastā:

# 36

Dark as the petal of a blue lotus, resembling an autumn cloud,
Three-eyed, single-faced, adorned with dark-blue garments, || 10-31 ||
Mounted upon the back of a lion, ready with bow and arrow in hand,
The great Goddess bearing a spear in her hand — meditated upon, She grants the fruit of one’s desire. || 10-32 ||
Siddhā, Raktā, likewise Śuṣkā, and Utpalahastā —
These four goddesses, O mothers of the retinue of Bhairava, stand in the four quarters. || 10-33 ||

# 37

Moreover:

# 38

In the intermediate quarters one should place the Dūtīs, beginning from the south-east quarter onwards:
Kālī, Karālī, Mahākālī,
And the renowned Bhadrakālī — established in the form of goddesses. || 10-34 ||

# 39

These in order:

# 40

…yet these goddesses are two-armed, seated in padmāsana,
Holding heroic scissors and a severed head…

# 41

All of them. “Scissors” means the heroic scissors (Vīra-kartikā).

Moreover:

# 42

…attendants at the door positions.

# 43

In order at the four doors:

# 44

Krodhanā, Vṛntaka, Karṣaṇa, and Gajānana — || 10-36 ||
Two-armed, deformed-faced, holding sword and shield.

# 45

This is declared as the form of the eight goddesses and the servants when they constitute the primary retinue of the Bhairava-couple.

For optional rites, however, He says:

# 46

For purposes of peace, all [deities] should be white…

# 47

“All” (masculine) and “all” (feminine) by the rule of ekaśeṣa.

# 48

…or [assume] the form according to the type of rite. || 10-37 ||

# 49

One should meditate upon them thus. “For subjugation red, for paralysing yellow”, etc., and the entire retinue up to the servants is to be worshipped with the root mantra — this is understood from the forthcoming section on protection rites. || 10-38 ||

Thus He says:

# 50

Now I shall declare the royal protection according to rule.
With the mantra placed at beginning and end, one should write the name in the middle. || 38 ||
Above that, one should worship the God Bhairava, Lord of nectar.
The goddesses are likewise to be placed in the petals with the same (mantra) joined at beginning and end. || 10-39 ||
The Dūtīs are to be assigned likewise, and the servants with the root mantra.
Outside the lotus one should draw a most excellent moon-disc,
And outside that a four-cornered figure marked with vajras. || 10-40–41 ||
Having drawn it with yellow pigment, saffron, milk, and white sugar,
One should worship for pacification with completely white offerings,
With appropriate food-offerings, fragrant substances, bali, and wine. || 42 ||

# 51

Having drawn the lotus with yellow pigment, saffron, milk, and white sugar, in the centre of its pericarp one writes the name of the person to be protected, enclosed (as before) by the Netra-mantra, placed upon the moon-disc. On its reverse side one worships Amṛteśa-Bhairava together with his consort by means of the root mantra (inferred from the context). In the petals, in the previously mentioned order of directions, one writes and worships the names of the goddesses and Dūtīs enclosed by the mantra. At the tips of the four directional petals one similarly writes the servants enclosed by the mantra. Outside, having made a square marked with vajras, one worships this mantra-wheel in sequence with completely white offerings and great provisions for the protection of the king. The offerings, bali, and wine are connected with “with”. || 10-43 ||

Having performed worship thus:

# 52

Mixed with white sandalwood, powdered camphor, and dust,
Unbroken rice and sesame together with white sugar, || 43 ||
Combined with ghee and milk — he who offers these in the fire with careful intelligence…

# 53

“Intelligence” here means the concentrated meditative awareness involved in nurturing others, etc.

# 54

For whatever purpose the fire-offering is performed, great peace quickly ensues.
Even if death has seized him… || 10-44 ||

# 55

Even if the target has been seized by death, through worship and offering in this protective wheel peace certainly arises — thus auspiciousness.

# 56

For diseases the divine medicine, for mental afflictions the cutting of the root,
For calamities their crushing — I resort to the Bhairava of the Eye of Consciousness.

# 57

Thus, on the Śrī Netra Tantra,  
in the *Netrodyota* composed by the venerable Kṣemarāja,  
who is supreme among the great Ācāryas devoted to Maheśvara,  
this concludes the tenth chapter:
**Attendants of the Deity**
