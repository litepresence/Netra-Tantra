# 1

Eighth Chapter
Neṭrodyotaḥ: The Illumination of the Eye

# 2

That Eye which is filled with abundant, undiminishing bliss,
beautiful in its playful vibration and swaying,
the great light of consciousness that is its own radiance—
that Eye of the Conqueror of Death triumphs!

# 3

After the subtle meditation (sūkṣma-dhyāna) [of the previous chapter], and in order to determine the supreme meditation (para-dhyāna), the blessed Lord spoke:

# 4

Now I shall declare the supreme Conqueror of Death (Mṛtyuñjaya), the eternal, the highest.
Having attained That, O Beloved, one no longer revolves in the threefold cycle of worldly existence. || 7 ||

# 5

The word “now” (atha) indicates sequence after the subtle meditation.
That which is eternally the Conqueror of Death, the devourer of time,
the supreme, unsurpassed form of the Lord—
“threefold” refers to the worlds of manifestation, maintenance, and reabsorption ending respectively in Māyā, Sadāśiva, and Śiva. || 8-1 ||

Furthermore:

# 6

The yogin shines as all-pervading, the seer of all, the doer of all, auspicious.
I shall now teach That from which nothing else exists.
Having attained It, one becomes That alone and thereby ageless and immortal. || 1 ||

# 7

For such supreme yogins there is no trace of the condition of knower beginning with the body etc.; hence there can be no talk whatsoever of old age, death, and the like.

To declare this very truth, the Lord begins:

# 8

That which eternal speech does not utter, which The Eye does not see, || 8-2 ||
which the ear does not hear, which the nose does not smell,
which the tongue does not taste, which the skin organ does not touch, || 8-3 ||
which the mind cannot think, which is devoid of all colour and flavour,
yet which is endowed with all colours and flavours, immeasurable, beyond the senses; || 8-4 ||
having attained which, O Goddess, yogins become ageless and immortal—
through intense practice of That and through supreme detachment, || 8-5 ||
through abandonment of attachment and aversion, through destruction of greed and delusion, O Beloved,
through renunciation of pride and arrogance, through extinction of the darkness of ego and conceit, || 8-6 ||
the eternal, everlasting, auspicious, imperishable, supreme is attained.

# 9

Even the triple speech (paśyantī, madhyamā, vaikhārī) that sees cannot express It.
It is beyond the reach of the inner and outer organs.
“Letters” (varṇa) are signifying words; “letters” are also the signified objects.
All such letters and their “flavours” (rasa = expressive powers) are abandoned—i.e., It is neither signifier nor signified.
Yet at the same time It is endowed with all of them because It is the very essence of the universe.
Therefore, being beyond the senses, It is not an object of knowledge; rather, It is concluded to be of the nature of the supreme Knower alone.
Having attained and fully entered That Reality which is of such nature…

# 10

“…they desire union (yoga) as oneness.” (Mālinīvijayottara 4-4)

# 11

—by this standpoint yogins who are filled solely with the supreme Reality become in truth free from old age and death. Through intense practice of That…

# 12

“…those who, having immersed their mind in Me, constantly united, worship Me…” (Bhagavad-gītā 12-2)

# 13

—by constant effort at immersion, by supreme detachment that depends on nothing seen or heard in scripture, by complete thirstlessness for all enjoyments, and thus by the pacification of all defects beginning with attachment and aversion, it is attained.
Because of honouring Śaṅkara, conceit is destroyed.
Thus is obtained the everlasting that has no illusory appearance, the eternal that is beyond the ordinary world, the auspicious that is the form of supreme beatitude, the imperishable that undergoes no modification, and therefore the supreme, the most excellent of all.

This is Its expanse:

# 14

If It is perceived even for the span of a single blink or unblink, || 8-7 ||
from that very moment he is liberated and never takes birth again.

# 15

“By some means” must be supplied. “Is perceived” means “is entered.”
“From that very moment” (tataḥ prabhṛti) means not at some later time.
“Liberated” means that even while body and Prāṇa still remain he is no longer qualified by them.
On discarding that body he does not take another; rather, he becomes the supreme Śiva Himself.

Thereupon the yogin…

# 16

…through the eight-limbed yoga alone attains It; never by any other means. || 8-8 ||

# 17

The Lord now teaches this eight-limbed yoga in sequence, differing from the form taught in other scriptures:

# 18

Constant turning away from Saṃsāra is declared the supreme yama.
Constant resting in the supreme Reality is declared niyama. || 8-9 ||

# 19

Clear. || 8-10 ||

# 20

Resting in the middle Prāṇa, in the interval between the paths of Prāṇa and apāna,
and holding fast to the power of knowledge, one obtains the seat that abides there. || 10 ||

# 21

Resting in the upward-moving udāna that is the middle Prāṇa in the central channel between the right and left paths of Prāṇa and apāna,
and thereby, through immersion of the diffusion of Prāṇa and the emergence of the diffusion of consciousness,
holding fast to the power of knowledge that flashes forth as dawning vibration and consciousness—
thus the yogin obtains the seat that abides there and, seated on the seat of his own power of knowledge, becomes the very form of the great Lord who is pure consciousness. || 8-11 ||

# 22

Abandoning the gross state beginning with Prāṇa, then the subtle inner one,
the supreme vibration beyond the subtle is attained.
That is declared prāṇāyāma, for from it one never falls again. || 11 ||

# 23

Having abandoned the gross state of Prāṇa, apāna, and samanā—i.e., the natural exhalation, inhalation, etc.—
then (after that gross prāṇāyāma) abandoning the subtle inner one consisting of retention and evacuation through the middle path—
because beyond even the subtle the supreme vibration, which is the flashing of pure consciousness prior to Prāṇa etc., is attained,
therefore that very supreme vibration is the restraint (āyāma) of the prāṇas that partake of gross and subtle divisions—
it is taught as the highest regulation whose essence is the cessation of the predominance of manifestation.
Because having attained that prāṇāyāma one never falls again from the state of being the conscious subject.

# 24

Whatever activity of sound and other qualities is experienced by the mind, || 8-12 ||
abandoning that, one should enter with one’s own consciousness the supreme abode.
That is declared pratyāhāra, the cutter of the noose of becoming. || 8-13 ||

# 25

Whatever activity or condition of the qualities beginning with sound, having the form of sattva etc., is experienced by consciousness—
abandoning that with indifference, one enters the abode of supreme consciousness solely by one’s own consciousness that is free of thought-constructs.
Hence pratyāhāra is the turning back of consciousness that had flowed out onto the plane of consciousness,
and therefore it is the cutter of the nooses of becoming. || 8-14 ||

# 26

Having transcended the qualities of intellect, meditating on the unchanging, all-pervading,
self-aware object of meditation—wise men know that as dhyāna. || 8-15 ||

# 27

Having transcended the qualities of intellect beginning with sattva by immersion and pacification,
“not to be meditated upon” means withdrawn from objects of meditation such as the principles beginning with Niyati;
they are withdrawn because It is beyond them.
It is all-pervading, unchanging, eternal, self-aware, self-luminous;
It is the object of meditation, worthy of meditation, to be intensely contemplated and remembered—
in short, the supreme Lord who is the mass of consciousness and bliss.
Those knowers of truth who contemplate and intensely reflect on Him
know that very reflection of Him as dhyāna in an unbroken tradition.
The particle ca has the sense of “indeed.” || 14 ||

# 28

That by which the state of supreme Self is constantly held—
that is declared dhāraṇā, destroyer of the bondage of becoming. || 15 ||

# 29

That concentration (dhāraṇā) of the yogin by which the state of supreme Self, pure consciousness, is constantly held and supported by immersion—
that concentration whose nature is the reflection of consciousness
is declared, in distinction from ordinary concentrations, to be the cause of destroying the bondage of becoming. || 8-16 ||

# 30

Thus having taught yama, niyama, āsana, prāṇāyāma, pratyāhāra, dhyāna, and dhāraṇā

# 31

from the transcendent viewpoint, the Lord now teaches samādhi—
attainable by the āṇava, Śākta, and Śāmbhava means, as well as by the no-means (anupāya)—
by means of a group of four verses:

# 32

The equal placement of the mind in all beings, the restraint of the mind,
is declared samādhāna; otherwise it is mere worldly hypocrisy. || 16 ||

# 33

The equal placement of the mind in all creatures—restraint of the mind consisting in removing the perception of inequality—
is called samādhāna.
Thinking “all this is equal to my own Self” is declared samādhāna.
Any other so-called samādhāna performed by closing the eyes etc. in the opposite way is solely for deceiving the world. || 8-17 ||

This samādhāna is the āṇava means using meditation. The Śākta means uses pure thought-construct. He now teaches that:

# 34

He who has equal vision in all beings here in this world—
“I am Śiva, the secondless”—that is remembered as the supreme samādhi. || 17 ||

# 35

The supreme samādhi is remembered in tradition as the determination arising from pure knowledge whose essence is the co-presence of “I” and “this”:
“All this is I alone.” || 8-18 ||

Now he teaches the ever-risen samādhi that is attained by the single stroke of the Śāmbhava means and that requires no other means:

# 36

That which is perfectly knowable through the single stroke of the Śāmbhava means,
which is of the nature of consciousness, born of its own nature,
which has the form of self-awareness—that knowers understand as the supreme samādhāna. || 18 ||

# 37

That which flashes forth perfectly through the single stroke of the Śāmbhava means,
which is consciousness by its very nature, the abode of light that shines—
that whose essence is self-awareness, which is non-emergent because eternally risen, is samādhāna. || 8-19 ||

He teaches the Śāmbhava samādhi that is the means of no-thought-construct:

# 38

Having intensely examined the two heaps—conscious and unconscious—
the eternal, everlasting form that is the real state—knowers understand that as samādhāna. || 19 ||

# 39

The unconscious heap is bodies, worlds, etc.
The conscious heap is the classes of knowers: sakala, pralayākala, Vijñānākala, mantra, mantreśvara, mantramaheśvara, and Śiva.
From the midst of these, having intensely examined and firmly reflected upon the abode that is the foundation of the universe,
the form that is eternal, indestructible, everlasting, devoid of illusory appearance and transformation,
and that always shines of itself—knowers of the truth understand that as samādhāna. || 8-20 ||

Concluding the teaching that began “through the eight-limbed yoga” and connecting it to the present context:

# 40

Thus, through this eight-limbed yoga, having seen the supreme, steadfast,
abiding in its own nature, one deceives Time, the Lord of Death who is supreme and all-pervading. || 20 ||
He becomes the Conqueror of Death, O Goddess; Time cannot overpower him.

# 41

“Thus” means in the manner described, not in the form of non-violence, truthfulness, etc. taught in other scriptures.
Having seen the supreme Lord of nectar who is consciousness, the all-pervading master of all causes that have no support—
one deceives Time and becomes solely the mass of consciousness and bliss that is not reckoned by time.
Hence in reality he alone is the Conqueror of Death who shatters death whose essence is contraction.
The intended remainder is that even one who has stabilised the body for a very long time is not in truth the Conqueror of Death.

Furthermore:

# 42

By abandoning the thirty-six tattvas, by discarding the infinity of worlds, || 8-21 ||
beyond the eighty-one pads, beyond the fifty letters,
pervading all mantras, the very life of all— || 8-22 ||
beyond the thirty-eight kalās, immanent in all, yet in the midst of all;
no one can attain Its beginning, middle, or end. || 8-23 ||
Having attained That immeasurable, incomparable Reality, nothing else is attained.

# 43

Having abandoned the tattvas from earth to Śiva and the worlds from Kālāgni to Anāśrita,
through processes beginning with the nine selves etc.,
beyond the fifty letters from a to the pranava etc.,
beyond the thirty-eight kalās of Īśāna, Puruṣa, Aghora, etc.—
It pervades all mantras, has transcended the six paths,
is therefore the very life of all beings,
is immanent in the beginning and end of all,
and because the universe abides in It, It is in the midst of all.
No one can attain Its beginning, middle, or end because It transcends direction, time, etc.
Hence It is immeasurable; because secondless, incomparable.
Yogins attain It by leaping beyond body, Prāṇa, etc., that consist of the six paths.
“Nothing else is attained” means the entire expanse of the paths is not attained as before, is not veiled as before;
rather, by the very fact that everything is not attained in the former way, everything is attained—
i.e., the state of Bhairava who is the Lord of nectar, the Self of all.

Likewise:

# 44

By that single immeasurable Reality the entire universe is filled. || 8-24 ||
Knowing That, one is swiftly released from the terrible bondage of Saṃsāra.

# 45

“Knowing” means firmly establishing.

Moreover:

# 46

That which is free from the three tattvas, eternal, unmoving, steadfast, || 8-25 ||
seen through the divine path of yoga, one is never born again.
Free from all senses, unknowable, free from disease. || 8-26 ||

# 47

The three tattvas are Nara, Śakti, and Śiva.
“Eternal” means not grasping a false or divided form like the doctrine of transformation.
Unmoving, unchanging; steadfast, eternal;
free from disease means not covered by the Māyā of the senses; unknowable.
Through the divine path of yoga—i.e., the means of resting in non-conceptual awareness that arises from the cessation of thought-constructs—
having directly realised It, one never takes birth again. || 8-27 ||

Thus the supreme Reality attained by āṇava, Śākta, and Śāmbhava means bestows liberation.
It is to be accepted not only here but in all scriptures. He says:

# 48

The nature of the supreme Self is declared in all scriptures
to be consciousness free from all limiting adjuncts, the very form of the Self. || 27 ||

# 49

That which is particularly free from all limiting adjuncts that contract—
that consciousness which is neither contracted nor non-contracted is the form of the Self, the knower.
That alone is the nature of the supreme Self, supreme Śiva—
not something different, as dualists imagine.
Hence it was said at the conclusion of the true samādhi: “I am Śiva, the secondless.”
This is taught in all scriptures, not merely in some.
Therefore even the scriptures of the Siddhānta, though secretly possessing the essence of non-duality,
do not make it manifest because of the deeply rooted dualistic tendency of worldly people.
As declared in the Śrī Kula-pañcāśikā:

# 50

“That which is not in all the world—people contradict saying ‘it exists.’
When it is uttered, O Goddess, it does not sprout in the heart.
For this reason, O Goddess, it has been concealed by the deities.
Therefore, O Queen of deities, what is not accomplished on earth by the accomplished one?”

# 51

Thus in the Śiva-sūtras, which are the essence of all Śaiva scriptures, it is stated right at the beginning: “Consciousness is the Self.” || 28 ||

Even though the nature of the Self is such…

# 52

…it does not become pure, O Goddess, until awakened by Śakti.

# 53

“Śaivī is here called the mouth.” (Vijñānabhairava 20)
Following the teaching of the revered Vijñāna-Bhaṭṭāraka,
by the limited soul whose nature is the reflection of Śakti
entering its own flashing through the path of immersion of limitedness,
supreme Śiva-hood dawns.

An objection: even limited souls whose Śiva-nature has been manifested by initiation remain different from supreme Śiva.
How then can identity of the consciousness of the Self with the nature of the supreme Self be stated?
He removes this doubt:

# 54

Those who say that the Self, purified by initiation, knowledge, etc., is something else || 28 ||
and do not find the supreme Śiva—
they are worshippers of the (limited) self in the Śaiva teaching and do not reach the supreme abode. || 8-29 ||

# 55

Those who, through initiation, knowledge, yoga, and practice, declare the purified Self to be something different, distinct from supreme Śiva,
do not find supreme Śiva, do not attain the form of supreme Śiva.
They are worshippers of the (limited) self, adorers of the pure tattva of the self,
and in the Śaiva teaching do not reach the supreme abode which is supreme Śiva-hood.
If ever, by a descent of intense Śakti, they do reach it,
it is solely by the non-dual knowledge taught by Śiva, not by any other knowledge.
This is to be connected with the seventh case in the third book.
As stated in the revered Svacchanda at the determination of the pure self in the seventh chapter:

# 56

“Those who, without knowing the supreme Reality, imagine Śiva-hood—
they are worshippers of the (limited) self in the Śaiva teaching and do not reach supreme Śiva.” (Svacchanda 4.392)

# 57

|| 8-30 ||

He clarifies the same idea differently:

# 58

Or rather, until the supreme Śakti endowed with omniscience and other qualities,
unfolding from the big toe etc., makes it pure, it is not made pure. || 30 ||
Until then the soul is called bound in the Śaiva teaching.

# 59

By the locative sense of “until” the word “until” is to be supplied.
Thus, by the gracious Śakti in the form of initiation, knowledge, etc.,
which unfolds from the big toe etc., which makes the predominance of consciousness emerge by immersion of the predominance of Prāṇa—
until the supreme Śakti whose nature is omniscience, omnipotence, freedom, etc., dawns,
until then the soul is not pure.
When it does dawn, that soul in the Śaiva teaching is called bound only until the non-attainment of liberation while living.

He shows the nature of the unfolded Śakti:

# 60

Remaining in which state the person knows everything past and future, || 8-31 ||
having restrained the group of senses—That is the Reality characterised by Śakti.

# 61

The yogin who, having turned the senses inward, abides in the state of the first flash at the moment of arising—
he knows everything past, future, etc.
That is the Reality of percept characterised by Śakti.

Likewise:

# 62

Wherever desire or knowledge arises, || 8-32 ||
or action in the form of accomplishing its object—
That is the Reality characterised by Śakti.

# 63

Wherever, at whatever moment, there arises desire that is non-conceptual, artificial,
knowledge that is flashing, action that is consciousness—
there That is the Reality characterised by Śakti whose essence is pure desire etc. uncontaminated by objects to be desired etc.

Likewise:

# 64

O Goddess, from which all-pervading Śiva who is consciousness alone || 8-33 ||

# 65

there flows forth wonderful bliss—That is remembered as the supreme Śakti.

For the yogin who contemplates the state of his own Self as nothing but all-pervading consciousness alone,
the Śakti that is wonderful bliss flows forth from Śiva—
That is remembered as the supreme, the Reality characterised by Śakti.

Through the expansion of resting in Śakti thus characterised:

# 66

Having expanded that Self with the qualities of omniscience etc., || 8-34 ||
he who is endowed with appearance is called, O Goddess, Śiva the supreme cause.

# 67

Having expanded the Self through reflection on those very qualities of omniscience etc.—
“the activity that is imagined as external is the great disembodied one, for the veil of light is destroyed” (Yoga-sūtra 3-43)—
by that state the yogin who is developed by those very qualities becomes endowed with them.
He who is endowed with the reflection of the appearance of omniscience etc. is called Śiva with appearance.

He clarifies the same:

# 68

He whose awareness is beginningless, who is completely satisfied, || 8-35 ||
autonomous, undiminished, possessed of infinite powers,
the possessor of Śakti—by distinction of qualities he enjoys his own qualities. || 8-36 ||
He reflects here on multiplicity by distinction of different parts.
He with appearance is declared; the appearance-less is declared. || 8-37 ||

# 69

Completely satisfied by absence of longing, the mass of consciousness and bliss;
beginningless, not arisen from imagination;
autonomous, not dependent like the lord of differences on ripening of karma and impurity;
undiminished, not veiled like Brahmā etc. in sleep;
possessed of infinite powers—

# 70

“His powers are the entire universe.”

# 71

—by that state he whose body is all the universe in the form of rays;
possessor of Śakti means having the nature of the arisen supreme Śakti as previously described;
by distinction of the qualities sattva, rajas, tamas on the plane of consciousness,
by the splitting arising from immersion of the knowership of body etc., he enjoys his own qualities—omniscience etc.
Endowed with those very qualities he is qualified by them.
He who reflects on multiplicity—the variegated appearance—by the distinction of the qualities of omniscience etc. that exclude what has been described,
he is declared “with appearance.” The appearance-less is declared.

He teaches that:

# 72

“I am not, nor is another”—then he becomes appearance-less.
That state is declared the supreme state of Śiva the supreme Self. || 8-38 ||

# 73

Withdrawn from appearances that are reflections of object and subject—
the ultimate reality that is pure reflection of consciousness.
As stated in the revered Pratyabhijñā:

# 74

“Śiva, who is the mass of consciousness and bliss, the supreme imperishable form,
filled with the multitude of infinite realities that have merged within in every way.” (Pratyabhijñā 4.1.14)

# 75

|| 8-39 ||

For the yogin who has attained this state, such is the flashing:

# 76

“I am not, nor is another; here no object of meditation exists.
The mind dissolved in the state of bliss has become one flavour.” || 39 ||

# 77

“I” means the knower beginning with the body.
“Another” means blue etc. distinct from me.
“Object of meditation” means what is presented by the intellect as to be favoured. || 8-40 ||

For the attainment of this state the Lord teaches the Śāmbhava means:

# 78

One should not practise meditation above, below, or in the middle,
nor in front, behind, or in either of the sides. || 40 ||
Nor in the inner arrangement of the body, nor anywhere externally.
One should not bind the target in space, nor place the gaze below. || 8-41 ||
Nor close the eyes at all, nor bind the gaze to anything.
One should not contemplate a support that has no support, nor contemplate a support that has support. || 8-42 ||
Nor the senses, nor the elements, nor sound, touch, taste, etc.
Having abandoned everything, established in samādhi, one should become solely filled with That. || 8-43 ||

# 79

“Above” means in the Dvādaśānta; “below” in the bulb etc.; “in the middle” in the heart etc.;
“in front, behind, sides” means in the forms of Tatpuruṣa, Sadyojāta, etc.
“Inner arrangement of the body” means as in:

# 80

“One should contemplate That which shines with rays from the root,
the most subtle of the subtle, dissolving at the end of the twelve.” (Vijñānabhairava 28)

# 81

“Not externally” means as in:

# 82

“When another object is known, emptiness in all objects of knowledge—
meditating on That alone with the mind, even though known, he becomes calm.” (Vijñānabhairava 122)

# 83

“Not in space” means as in:

# 84

“Having placed the gaze in space coloured by the light of sun, lamp, etc.,
there the form of one’s own Self shines.” (Vijñānabhairava 76)

# 85

“Not below” means as in:

# 86

“Remaining in a deep pit such as a well and looking upward,
for one whose mind is free of thought-constructs, instantly and clearly the dissolution of the mind occurs.” (Vijñānabhairava 115)

# 87

“Not closing the eyes” means as in:

# 88

“Thus closing the eyes and spreading the form of Bhairava
dark in front, contemplating, one becomes filled with That.” (Vijñānabhairava 88)

# 89

“Not binding the gaze” means as in:

# 90

“One should cast the gaze in a place devoid of trees, walls, etc.
When thought is dissolved, one becomes diminished in activities.” (Vijñānabhairava 60)

# 91

“Support” means the contemplated form with characteristics—

# 92

“When a thought is abandoned and consciousness is restrained,
it does not go to another thought. Then, by the state in the middle, supreme contemplation expands.” (Vijñānabhairava 62)

# 93

“No support” means as in:

# 94

“Having known the two knowledges and resting in the middle,
abandoning both simultaneously, in the middle the Reality shines.” (Vijñānabhairava 61)

# 95

“With support” means knowledge with form—

# 96

“Or when desire or knowledge arises, one should place the mind there.
Then, with intellect free of other thoughts, there arises vision of the Self.” (Vijñānabhairava 98)

# 97

“Not senses, not elements” means according to the method taught in the chapter on concentrations—
having abandoned everything, established in samādhi,
inclined solely to reflection of one’s own true nature, filled with That,
consisting of knowledge that has become one flavour dissolved in the state of bliss. || 8-44 ||

And this very state:

# 98

That state is declared the supreme state of the supreme Lord.
That is the appearance-less abode; having attained It, one returns no more. || 44 ||

# 99

One abandons worldly existence. || 8-45 ||

Hence he who…

# 100

…contemplates the Self in this way by the power of contemplation of the Self,
he reaches the supreme peace, Śiva, utterly pure. || 45 ||

# 101

The contemplation of one’s own non-conceptual awareness—
its establishment by abandonment of thought-constructs—
by the strength of that intense reflection one should contemplate. || 8-46 ||

Furthermore:

# 102

That single Reality which is the Conqueror of Death and Śiva is present everywhere.
That supreme Lord of nectar is the third, the highest abode. || 46 ||
I have declared it to you, O Queen of deities—what else shall I tell you?

# 103

Everywhere, up to the end of earth and Anāśrita—
That alone, the secondless, the true nature, auspicious, the form of the highest good, becomes the Conqueror of Death.
“Third” in relation to the previously mentioned gross and subtle knowledge.
“To you” who are solely devoted to grace.
“What else shall I tell?” means there is no other secret to be told beyond this.

He concludes:

# 104

Thus, having contemplated everything pervaded by the Conqueror of Death, the yogin is liberated. || 8-47 ||

# 105

The yogin. || 8-48 ||

This also:

# 106

At all times the deceiving of Time has been taught, O Beloved.

# 107

From the teaching of immersion in the abode of consciousness that is not reckoned by time.

Concluding the present topic and bringing to a close what was previously introduced:

# 108

Thus, O Goddess, the deceiving of Time in its threefold form has been revealed by Me to you. || 48 ||

# 109

This…

# 110

…yoga is supremely difficult to obtain.

# 111

Furthermore:

# 112

By practice of this yoga a man becomes the Conqueror of Death. || 8-49 ||

# 113

Not only for himself, but also…

# 114

By this very yoga, out of desire to grace the worlds,
the yogin who is the Conqueror of Death arises for all beings at all times. || 8-50 ||

# 115

One established in this knowledge is capable of gracing the universe.

That which in this chapter has been taught as the supreme knowledge:

# 116

This renowned Conqueror of Death is eternal, supreme, steadfast.
There is nothing higher than This—I tell you truly. || 8-51 ||

# 117

Out of affection, desiring that firm assurance arise in the disciples regarding this matter,
because it is supremely worthy of acceptance, he repeatedly teaches it:

# 118

That form of supreme nectar which I have declared in its threefold way—
through practice of That a being becomes equal to the Lord of nectar, whether for himself or for another. || 8-52 ||
Equal to the Lord of nectar, the Conqueror of Death, O Goddess—there is no doubt.

# 119

Moreover, this Lord called Conqueror of Death:

# 120

In whatever manner and wherever one remembers Him, || 8-53 ||
by that very feeling the yogin becomes conqueror of Time.

# 121

“In whatever manner” means by āṇava, Śākta, or Śāmbhava means.
“Wherever” means there is no restriction of place, time, or condition.

This yogin:

# 122

Wherever he abides, by whatever vow, || 8-54 ||
by whatever yoga, by whatever difference of feeling, he attains success.

# 123

“By whatever yoga” means taught in the yoga section of the respective tantras;
“difference of feeling” means special devotion resting in the Reality.

And this supreme Reality called Lord of nectar:

# 124

Meditated upon as one, O Goddess, in many ways, it bestows success. || 8-55 ||
Whether in dual, non-dual, mixed, in the single hero, or in the yāmala—
by every method of every scripture, at all times, it bestows success. || 8-56 ||

# 125

“One” means the supreme non-dual free consciousness-Reality;
therefore “in many ways” means contemplated in the forms of revered Sadāśiva, Tumburu, great Bhairava, lord of the Kula, etc.,
to be taught in future chapters by the flashing of freedom—
thus it bestows success.
Because this Lord is of the nature of supreme non-duality,
there is no contradiction in His encompassing all methods—dual, non-dual, etc.
He will declare in the twenty-first chapter:

# 126

“Non-dual, free from imagination, the mass of consciousness.” (21-23)

# 127

|| 8-57 ||

Furthermore:

# 128

Just as a wish-fulfilling gem in the world grants the fruit of whatever is wished,
so the king of mantras grants the fruit of whatever is wished. || 57 ||

# 129

The one belonging to this tantra. || 8-58 ||

Furthermore:

# 130

The abode of the seven crores of mantras, the supreme, most powerful.

# 131

Because even they possess the single non-dual energy.

Moreover:

# 132

Mantras that are devoid of feeling, devoid of Śakti, nailed, || 58 ||
devoid of even a single letter, devoid of the tradition of the guru,
devoid of the broken lineage, obstructed by deviation from scripture, || 8-59 ||
do not succeed, O Goddess, even when repeated and worshipped thousands of times.
Those that are unsuccessful, hostile, devoid of all parts, || 8-60 ||
enclosed by the initial and final capsule with the seed syllable—
by this mantra, O Queen of deities, the Lord of nectar revives them. || 8-61 ||
They succeed without effort when repeated and worshipped—there is no doubt.
Meditated upon, they grant everything, O Goddess—My word is not false. || 8-62 ||

# 133

Devoid of feeling means of unknown potency; devoid of Śakti means without life-breath.
As stated:

# 134

“Those with life-breath are in the middle of the egg, sattvic, rajasic, tamasic.”

# 135

Nailed means with reversed letters and words;
devoid of the tradition of the guru means taken by disciples themselves from books;
broken lineage means not arising from known tantras, hence ruined;
obstructed by deviation from scripture means constantly overwhelmed by obstacles through employment for petty siddhis.
Unsuccessful, hostile means: when the letters of the mantra are counted repeatedly on the four joints of the fingers according to the order of the mātṛkā from the name-letters,
if it touches the first joint it succeeds; if the second, it succeeds for the object;
if the third, it is greatly successful; but if the fourth joint, it is hostile.
All parts means the well-known flower-fall etc.
Such matters are to be known from the revered Svacchanda etc.
Even mantras of this kind, when enclosed by the capsule of the Lord of the Eye,
repeated, worshipped, and meditated upon, grant all success.
“No doubt” and “My word is not false” reassure even those who lack assurance. || 8-63 ||

He concludes:

# 136

Thus everything has been fully explained—the supreme secret, O Beloved. || 63 ||

# 137

That supreme secret which was asked in the first chapter
has now been fully explained in the manner described.

Auspiciousness. || 64 ||

# 138

The abode that is the mass of consciousness and bliss, Śāṅkara, the supreme nectar—
the revered Conqueror of Death triumphs, uplifting the universe by his own immersion.

# 139

Thus, on the Śrī Netra Tantra,  
in the *Netrodyota* composed by the venerable Kṣemarāja,  
who is supreme among the great Ācāryas devoted to Maheśvara,  
this concludes the eighth chapter:
**Its Supreme Form**
