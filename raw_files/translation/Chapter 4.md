Fourth Chapter
Neṭrodyotaḥ: The Illumination of the Eye

# 2

The supreme divine Eye on the glorious forehead,
casting a sidelong glance upward and downward with corners of the eyes conjoined,
bestowing liberation (mokṣa) through that very glance,
together with enjoyment (sa-bhogam) — victoriously shines that auspicious third Eye of the Lord.

# 3

Having the intent that “after the regular (nitya) karma comes the occasional (naimittika),”
the illustrious Bhagavān spoke:

# 4

Now I shall explain dīkṣā, which bestows both enjoyment (bhukti) and liberation (mukti).

# 5

Bhukti-dīkṣā, for the sādhaka, is differentiated by Śiva-dharma and laukika-dharma.  
Mukti-dīkṣā, however — whose cause is the attainment of Īśvara-tattva — is for the samayin.  
Both the ācārya and putraka receive both types,  
because they are entitled, as per the maṇḍalas described in the adhivāsa and subsequent rites in the venerable Svacchanda and other Tantras.

# 6

Dīkṣā should be performed with thirty-six tattvas, or with half that number, or with five,  
or with three, or with one alone, for the sake of parāpara-vibhūti. || 3 ||

# 7

The thirty-six (tattvas) are from earth up to Śiva.
Half of that (eighteen) are: the five elements,
Prakṛti, puruṣa, rāga, Niyati, śuddha-vidyā, Kāla, kalā, Māyā, vidyā, īśa, Sadāśiva, Śakti,
and Śiva — thus eighteen.
Half of that again (nine) are: Prakṛti, puruṣa, Niyati, Kāla, Māyā, vidyā, īśa,
Sadāśiva, and Śiva.
The five are the elements beginning with earth, pervading the universe up to the nivṛtti-kalā etc.
The three are the powers of worlds, powers, and Śiva, pervading Māyā, Sadāśiva, and Śiva.
The one is the all-encompassing principle of Śiva and the rest of the universe.
The higher and lower glories — liberation and enjoyment — are to be accomplished everywhere without distinction. || 4-1 ||

Having thus indicated the six kinds of tattva-dīkṣā,
he now indicates kalā-dīkṣā etc.:

# 8

Or else dīkṣā may be performed with the five kalās,
or again with (ten) “steps” (pada),
or with the fifty letters, or with mantras, or likewise with worlds (bhuvana). || 1 ||

# 9

The kalās are: nivṛtti, Pratiṣṭhā, vidyā, Śānti, and śāntyatītā.  
According to the system of Śrīpūrva and following the mātṛkā order:  
kṣa, ha, sa, ṣa, śa, va, la, ra, ya, ma, bha,  
ba, pha, pa, na, dha, da, tha, ta, ṇa, ḍha, ḍa, ṭha, ṭa, ña, jha, ja, ch, ca, ṅa, gha, ga,  
kha, ka — these are nine padas.  
The tenth pada, being the resting place of the universe, extends from visarga to the end of akāra.  
According to the vision of the Svacchanda Tantra, however,  
there are eighty-one padas beginning with ū as taught in the ninefold self-expansion.  
According to the Śrīsvāyambhuva and similar systems, they are related to that which pervades the vyoma (space).  
The varṇas from kṣa to ka are thirty-four in number and denote the tattvas from pṛthvī up to Sadāśiva;  
those from visarga to the end of akāra are sixteen and indicate the non-difference of Śakti and Śiva-tattva.  
According to the Śrīpūrva system, the padas are described in terms of madhyamā-vāk-vṛtti;  
mantras, by contrast, are those in which difference and non-difference are threaded together, with emphasis on paśyantī-vṛtti.  
In the Svacchanda system, however, they are only the aṅgas: hṛt (heart), śiras (head), śikha (tuft), Kavaca (armor), astra (weapon), Netra (Eye)—  
these very aṅgas are the vaktṛ-mantras beginning with Sadyojāta,  
which, through the sequence of pervasion by the five kalās beginning with nivṛtti, encompass all the adhvans.  
In this (Netra) system, since the vaktṛ-mantras are absent, only the aṅgas are used.  
As for the bhuvanas: according to the Śrīpūrva system, there are 118;  
according to the Svacchanda view, 224.  
Since this śāstra is a synthesis of all streams (sarva-srotaḥ-saṅgraha),  
there is no contradiction in the dīkṣā procedure due to the sixfold adhvan divisions taught in the respective Āgamas. || 4-2 ||

When the opportunity arises, dīkṣā should be performed by the aforesaid methods:

# 10

It should be performed with all these…

# 11

Otherwise, however:

# 12

… it may be performed with any one of them. || 2 ||

# 13

Even in a single type,

# 14

with all six paths collectively…

# 15

dīkṣā should be performed.

How? He says:

# 16

… from the standpoint of the manifestation of Śakti.

# 17

Having purified one particular path, taking it predominantly as the manifested form (vyakti-rūpa) in its pervasive aspect,
one should contemplate the remaining five paths as being pervaded in the form of Śakti.
That is the meaning. As stated in the venerable Svacchanda:
“After contemplating the paths
from the standpoint of pervaded and pervader” (4.95), etc.

And this entire dīkṣā

# 18

should be performed by the foremost of preceptors according to their capacity and resources. || 4-3 ||

# 19

Those who possess abundant resources (vibhava) should perform it with great materials;
others even with blades of dūrvā grass, water, tender leaves, etc.
Thus indeed, through freedom from laziness and greed, comes the excellence of preceptors. || 4-4 ||

There, first, after performing the linking of the paths (adhva-saṃdhāna) depending on the thread of bonds in the disciple’s body,
the evocation of the paths, worship of the paths, oblation for the paths,
contemplation of the three bonds within the paths, imposition of the ādhāra-Śakti, etc.,

# 20

worship of Vāgīśī should be performed…

# 21

from invocation up to the final oblation — that is the implied meaning.

Then, after sprinkling, striking, and seizing the consciousness of the disciple,

# 22

… one should unite the bound soul (paśu) within its womb.

# 23

So that, under the power of the karma-bond, there may arise the varied fourteen kinds of abodes of enjoyment.

And of this (process):

# 24

Impregnation (garbhādhāna), birth, consecration (adhikāra), dissolution (laya),
enjoyment (bhoga), accumulation of karma, and then expiation (niṣkṛti) — || 4 ||

# 25

All this should be performed with the root mantra…
The sprouting within of manifold bodies is impregnation;
emergence outside is birth;
the attainment of prosperity of those matured for enjoyment is consecration;
thereafter, the accumulation of karma that has become ripe through the greatness of the mantra for bestowing enjoyment;
then enjoyment whose nature is the attainment of pleasure, pain, and delusion;
even after enjoyment has ceased, for some time the impression of enjoyment remains — that is dissolution (laya);
thereafter, when all births, lifespan, and enjoyments are completely exhausted — that is expiation (niṣkṛti).
All this is to be performed with oblations of the root mantra in numbers beginning with three;
expiation, however, requires one hundred oblations.
At the end of that, one should contemplate the disciple’s attainment of twice-born status and partaking of a portion of Rudra.

When the enjoyments are completed, having performed the rite called viśleṣa (separation), whose nature is the absence of the state of enjoyer,

# 26

… cutting of the bonds is also remembered. || 4-5 ||

# 27

With the weapon-mantra…

Then, after contemplating the cutting of the thread of bonds that follows viśleṣa, having cut the thread of bonds with the weapon-mantra, with that very same (mantra)

# 28

… burning of the bonds…

# 29

should be performed.

Thereafter:

# 30

… complete reduction to ashes while it remains there.

# 31

Reduction to ashes means the pacification, by the weapon itself, of the bonds that have no further residue.
“As it remains there” (tat-sthite): having conceived the oneness, with the root (mantra), of the disciple’s consciousness — from which all bodily residue has departed —
and having caused it to enter one’s own heart and reach the Dvādaśānta,
the “remaining” (sthiti) is the state of being situated in the disciple’s heart.
By the derivation “sthita” (situated), it is called tat-sthita.

# 32

Thereafter, after performing invocation, worship, oblation, offering of the subtle body (puryaṣṭaka) portion,

# 33

causing to be heard, dismissal, etc., of Brahmā and the others,
and after accomplishing the purification of all paths with successive connection from kalā up to the inner tattvas,

# 34

one should then perform the cutting of the tuft and the oblation…

# 35

That is, having cut the tuft — which is the energy of vital breath resting on the universal path — one should offer oblation by means of its pervasion.

Then, after the oblations of atonement that arise according to the possibility of ritual error,

# 36

“Having known the inner pramāṇa and the circulation of Prāṇa…” (4.231)

# 37

— thus the excellent preceptor who knows the fifteenfold reality taught in the venerable Svacchanda,
who possesses the yoga of knowledge,

# 38

… should unite (the disciple) with the root (mantra) alone. || 4-6 ||

# 39

“Renouncing mental activity, he should unite (him) through pure awareness alone.
Then the bound soul attains Śiva-nature, liberated from the ocean of transmigration.” (4.437)
— thus, according to the vision taught in the venerable Svacchanda,
one should make (the disciple) of one form with the Supreme Śiva through immersion in the highest reality. || 4-7 ||

That he states:

# 40

Having united (him) in the supreme reality, one should establish his abode there.

# 41

Thus he himself becomes completely filled with That.

Now he states the divisions among those to be united:

# 42

For the sake of entitlement: when the preceptor is situated in the parāpara level,
for sādhakas in the state of Śiva-hood, one should know dīkṣā in Sadāśiva;
for the putraka in the supreme reality, and for the samayin in the īśvara (tattva). || 7 ||

# 43

“In the parāpara level, in Śiva-hood” —

# 44

“Here the one who has ascended performs (as) Śiva, the supreme cause” (10.1258)

# 45

— according to the teaching of the Svacchanda:

# 46

After uniting the preceptors with the Supreme Śiva, one should perform their union with the lower Śiva;

# 47

for sādhakas, after union with Śiva, one should perform union with Sadāśiva;
for putrakas in the supreme reality itself;
and for samayins in the Īśvara-tattva — such are the divisions. || 4-9 ||

He concludes:

# 48

Thus dīkṣā has been taught in summary form; the detailed exposition is elsewhere. || 9 ||

# 49

By “in summary” and “elsewhere” he teaches that
although this ritual of dīkṣā is extremely vast,
here it has been presented in the most concise form, as a mere thread;
it should be fully understood in detail from scriptures such as the venerable Svacchanda and others, and then applied.
Thus auspiciousness.

# 50

Victorious is The Eye of the Great Lord
that completely burns away the flood of all bonds
for those rich in devotion,
and grants entry into the supreme abode.

# 51

Thus, on the Śrī Netra Tantra,  
in the *Netrodyota* composed by the venerable Kṣemarāja,  
who is supreme among the great Ācāryas devoted to Maheśvara,  
this concludes the fourth chapter:
**Initiation into the Worship of the Deity**
