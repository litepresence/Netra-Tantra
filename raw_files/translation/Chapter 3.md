Third Chapter
Neṭrodyotaḥ: The Illumination of the Eye

Thus he speaks:

# 2

O Goddess of gods! The knower of mantras should first take up earth (mṛd) with the Astra-mantra,
perform external purification as prescribed, and thereafter commence the bath. || 3-1 ||

# 3

The connection is: having performed bodily purification according to the rules laid down in Smṛti and other scriptures, he should take up earth with the Astra-mantra and begin the bath. || 3-2 ||

Therein, first in the order of dissolution (saṁhāra-krama):

# 4

The feet, shanks, waist, and thighs — these are to be washed first, each with three handfuls of earth.

# 5

“Washed” is to be supplied as the complement; “with three” (is in the feminine due to) linguistic irregularity (liṅga-vyatyaya). The same is to be understood in the other cases as well.

Wondering whether this may be done without interruption, he says:

# 6

With three applications without interruption…

# 7

The act of washing the hands three times without interruption is connected with the washing of the feet: thus one washes the feet, then the hands; then the shanks, then the hands; then the thighs, then the hands; then the waist. This is the meaning here.

Having done thus:

# 8

…he becomes purified again with seven (handfuls). || 2 ||

# 9

That is, with the seven handfuls of earth taken for washing the hands. || 3 ||

Thereafter:

# 10

The knower of mantras should take earth that has been empowered seven times with the Astra-mantra,
heat it until it faces the sun, and then smear it over the body. || 3-3 ||

# 11

“Knower of mantras” means one who knows the power of the Astra that burns away the previously mentioned sins; “facing the sun” means turned toward the visible sun or, if the sun is not visible, touched by the inner sun (prāṇārka); this smearing is according to one’s own intention. || 3-4 ||

# 12

For the pacification of obstacles…

# 13

With water…

# 14

…having rinsed the body, one should perform ācamana.

# 15

For the purification of the puryaṣṭaka (subtle body), three sips (ācamana) with the Praṇava, twice brushing the lips, and touching the openings (of the senses) — thus!

Having spoken of the bath with impurities (mala-snāna) for the sake of ācamana, he now teaches the ritual bath (vidhi-snāna):

# 16

On the palm of the left hand one should make three portions of the bathing earth (mṛtsnā). || 4 ||

# 17

The excellent earth is called mṛtsnā; “three portions” — according to the method taught in the venerable Svacchanda-tantra and elsewhere — are to be placed in front, to the right, and to the left. || 3-5 ||

Therein:

# 18

He should throw the Astra-empowered (portion) toward the directions…

# 19

The portion that is in front.

# 20

…he should fashion the central one into a tīrtha.

# 21

That is, with the left portion empowered by the Mūla-mantra he should fashion the Śiva-tīrtha.

# 22

Touching the body with the (six) Aṅgas and washing it, he should then perform japa within the water. || 5 ||

# 23

“With the Aṅgas” means with the earth of the right portion that has been empowered by the six Aṅgas. “Within the water” means inside the water. || 3-6 ||

What and how much should he repeat? He answers:

# 24

The Mūla together with Śakti…

# 25

He should repeat the Mūla-mantra together with Śakti according to his capacity.

Thereafter:

# 26

…having emerged (from the water), he should duly worship the Sandhyā.

# 27

According to the method taught in the venerable Svacchanda-tantra and elsewhere: consecrating the head with the Kalasha-mudrā, emerging from the water, dropping downward with the Astra-mantra the water-drops held in the left hand using the fingers of the right hand, and upward with the Heart and other mantras, etc. — such is the Sandhyā worship.

Furthermore:

# 28

Binding the Śikhā, meditating on the Śikhā, thereafter the satiation (tarpaṇa) of the mantras.

# 29

|| 3-7 ||
Having meditated on the Śikhā-mantra, having tied the top-knot of the Śikhā and then having bound the middle Śakti of the Śikhā, remaining there he should perform the tarpaṇa of the mantras whose essence is their power. || 6 ||

Thereafter:

# 30

Having satiated gods, ancestors, ṛṣis, and human beings together with the bhūtas,
gathering the tīrtha, he should enter the house of sacrifice in the proper manner. || 7 ||

# 31

Having satiated all mantras, having made the Śiva-tīrtha absorbed into his own Self through the act of grasping the mantras by meditative identification, he should enter the sacrifice-house according to the future ritual. || 3-8 ||

He teaches that ritual:

# 32

He should worship the Mothers of the directions, Lakṣmī, Nandi and Gaṅgā,
and Mahākāla together with Yamunā, then the threshold. || 8 ||

# 33

The Mothers of the outer directions; above the door, Gaṇapati and Lakṣmī; on both sides, Nandi and Gaṅgā, Mahākāla and Yamunā; on the left, the threshold — these are to be worshipped with Praṇava in the fourth case and the word namaḥ. Because this system is all-accommodating, from the Siddhānta viewpoint Nandi and Gaṅgā are to be worshipped on the right, Mahākāla and Yamunā on the left. In the left-current tradition there are additionally Meṣāsya and Chāgāsya on right and left respectively. In the Bhairava current, since dissolution predominates, Mahākāla and Yamunā are on the right, Nandi and Gaṅgā on the left. In the Ṣaḍardha tradition, Ḍiṇḍi and Mahodara are the additional ones. || 9 ||

Thereafter, having thrown inside with the Nārāca-astra a radiant flower empowered seven times with the Astra:

# 34

Having accomplished the expulsion of obstacles, he should bind the directions with the Kavaca and Astra.

# 35

Having expelled with the Astra the obstacles situated in Pātāla and elsewhere by the striking of the heels, loud sounds of clapping, etc., he should bind the directions with the Kavaca so that the expelled obstacles cannot re-enter.

Thereafter still:

# 36  

Then, for the sake of his own seat, he should first mentally fashion the auspicious Ādhāra-Śakti (the foundational power imagined as a radiant lotus or the coiled Kuṇḍalinī beneath the body).  
Having thus seated himself upon her, he then performs prāṇāyāma in due sequence. ‖ 3-9 ‖

# 37

For his own consciousness-Self, having fashioned as seat the supreme creative Śakti who is the support (ādhāra) because she sustains the entire path of the universe from all sides — with “OṂ namaḥ to the Ādhāra-Śakti” — and having made himself rest upon that, he should perform prāṇāyāma in the order of willed recaka, pūraka, and kumbhaka, so that the Śakti-power stationed at the Dvādaśānta may touch him and produce extraordinary states in the body for the purpose of burning it. || 3-10 ||

Thereafter, having first performed the nyāsa for purification of the hands:

# 38

Here he should commence dhāraṇā together with simultaneous drying-up, etc. || 10 ||
He should meditate there that the body, consisting of the six sheaths, is impure and burnt.

# 39

The meaning is: visualising the earth-support marked with the vajra of square yellow form, and firmness; the water-support marked with the lotus of white half-moon form, and nourishment; then with the wind-support that is black, circular, marked with six dots and the letter ya, he should meditate on the drying up of the body, etc. When this is done, the impure body — consisting of skin, flesh, blood, marrow, bone, and semen — should be meditated as burnt by the Kālāgni rising from the big toe, through contemplation of the fire-support that is red, triangular, marked with the Śakti-letter ra. This is for the cessation of the sense of “I”. || 3-11 ||

Thereafter:

# 40

There he should remember only pure Knowledge, empty (of objects), all-pervading. || 11 ||

# 41

In that body that has been contemplated, because it is empty of objects of knowledge, he should remember only the all-pervading pure Consciousness. || 3-12 ||

From such meditation:

# 42

“I am not, nor is there another; nor is there here anything to be meditated upon.
The mind, merged in the state of bliss, has become of one flavour.” || 12 ||

# 43

“I am not” — the limited knower; “another” — external objects such as blue, etc.; “to be meditated upon” — nothing internal that arises — nothing at all has place here. Having thus understood, when the limited state is calmed, through entry into the expansive flow of Śakti, the mind that is pure and consists only of Consciousness becomes merged in the state of bliss and of one flavour. || 3-13 ||

# 44

Thus, immediately after the nyāsa of the ātma-mūrti (the placement of one’s own divine form),
[he now describes] the nyāsa of the mantra-mūrti that is of the single nature of both sakala and niṣkala …

# 45

… preceded by the nyāsa of the appropriate āsana (seat/throne), he teaches.

# 46

Thereafter he should contemplate his own seat upon the Ādhāra-Śakti:
the (primeval) sustainer, the ocean of milk, the lotus illumined by the orb of the moon. || 13 ||
Thereafter he should sprinkle it with the nectar produced by the dissolution of time (Kāla-kalā).
He should fashion the three principles that have taken form with the Mūla itself. || 3-14 ||

# 47

“Thereafter” means after purification of the body, etc. The sustainer, ocean of nectar, and lotuses are in order the pervasion of the principles of earth, water, and fire; and they are embraced by space — thus within the Ādhāra-Śakti.

# 48

“Earth, water, likewise fire, wind, and space —
these five principles by which the entire world is pervaded.” (Kālottara 8.1-2)

# 49

According to this arrangement, having accepted the pentad of principles that comprises the entirety of the manifested path, he should place with the Praṇava as seat for his own Self these five principles. Upon them, with the Mūla-mantra, he should intensely fashion the God who is the essence of the three principles beginning with Self, etc., whose body is suitable for the meditation fashioned from the thirty-eight kalās beginning with Nivṛtti, in the form of the nectar of supreme bliss, pure and all-pervading. || 3-15 ||

# 50

Thereafter he should again fashion the Aṅgas on the body with both hands.

# 51

“Again” — the special intention here is that upon the niṣkala Self he should fashion the six Aṅgas that have the form of the qualities of omniscience, etc., by savouring the pair of powers, knowledge and action, that have blossomed forth, thereby causing the arising of the niṣkala nature.

# 52

He should contemplate the mantric and the egoic sense through the yoga of meditation. || 15 ||

# 53

He should enter with one-pointedness the contemplation of the essence of the power of the mantras that have been explained and are yet to be explained. || 16 ||

Thereafter, for the sake of presence (of the deity), he says:

# 54

Binding the Amṛtā mudrā or alternatively the Padma mudrā,
he should meditate on the Lord of gods within himself, brilliant like ten million moons. || 3-16 ||
Resembling a pure crystal, brilliant like a crystal mountain,
like jasmine, moon, and cow’s milk, like a mountain of ice, all-pervading. || 3-17 ||
Adorned with white garlands, moon-ornaments, white flowers, and other white ornaments,
limbs anointed with white sandal, grey with camphor dust. || 3-18 ||
Flooded with the swelling waves of the flowing nectar of the shining moon,
seated in the midst of the lunar orb, one-faced, three-eyed. || 3-19 ||
Seated upon a white lotus in padmāsana with legs crossed,
four-armed, with large eyes, hands granting boons and fearlessness. || 3-20 ||
Resembling the full moon, auspicious white, filled with nectar,
holding a jar that causes the world to flourish. || 3-21 ||
One should contemplate in his left hand a full moon as well.

# 55

The Amṛtā-mudrā (is formed) by the left little finger placed transversely upon the raised thumb of the right hand, with the other fingers of the right hand clasped — because of the supreme fullness of the supreme nectar. Elsewhere it is said:

# 56

“Having made the left hand upward and the right hand loosely fisted,
with the thumb raised — this hand is called the Kāla-śī mudrā.”

# 57

Alternatively the Padma-mudrā with interlocked thumbs and spread blossoming hands — whose intention is the expansion of the entire universe into its own true nature — having bound that, he should meditate on the Lord of gods within himself, within his own true nature. That is: with the splendour of the unrestricted great Self that is the unconditioned light of consciousness, he should contemplate his own form as the most joyful, white, moon-like form that delights the entire universe manifested on the canvas of the Self, shining forth. “Shining moon” here means the moon held in the hand. One-faced because of union with the unique autonomous Śakti that has no equal. Three-eyed because of union with the triad of powers — will, knowledge, and action — manifested by His greatness. Seated upon a white lotus means mounted upon the lotus of Śakti; because of the binding of padmāsana and because of the supreme expansion of the powers beginning with Śānti of the God who is non-different from Śāntyatīta, four-armedness; because of the impulse to reveal the universe, large-eyedness. The right and left hands holding boon, fearlessness, the full moon, and the jar of nectar are the manifestation of the blossoming forth of His own nature that is knowledge and action, granting all siddhis and uprooting all fear. || 3-22 ||

Having thus meditated on His form:

# 58

He should remember Him worshipped with all-white offerings. || 22 ||

# 59

“Offering” means that by which worship is performed: flowers, food-offerings, etc. || 3-23 ||

Thus it is:

# 60

Why say much here…

# 61

For this God…

# 62

…is verily the ocean of nectar itself.

# 63

And this is fitting,

because:

# 64

From Him alone has arisen the nectar that gives life to the universe. || 23 ||

# 65

The arisen, fully manifest nectar is the supreme Śākta power. || 3-24 ||

Wondering in what form this God, for the sake of bestowing grace upon those to be graced, does not shine forth, he says with that intention:

# 66

Thereafter he should remember Him as resembling the wish-fulfilling gem, according to differences of mental disposition.

# 67

By the differences of disposition — the impurities of desire, etc. — through splitting them.

And that (God):

# 68

Gentle, fierce, terrible, deformed — according to differences of disposition. || 24 ||
Sadāśiva, Tumburu, Bhairava, and the leader of heroes.

# 69

“The leader of heroes” means the Lord of the Kula. That is, manifested in various wonderful forms bestowing grace according to the variety of the mental disposition of the sādhaka. As it is said:

# 70

“In whatever form the sādhaka always remembers (Him),
in that very form the Lord, like a wish-fulfilling gem, becomes identical with him.”

# 71

Because of His compassion. || 3-25 ||

# 72

Having thus meditated, he should worship the God with auspicious mental flowers. || 25 ||

# 73

Mental ones suitable for the respective siddhis. || 3-26 ||

Having taught thus for the sādhaka, he now speaks in general:

# 74

…thereafter he should perform external worship.

# 75

After mental worship, the most excellent worship is accomplished with flowers etc. that have been washed with the drops from the arghya-pātra consecrated by the mantra-cakra; therefore mental worship should be performed first.

Furthermore:

# 76

Worship performed with mental flowers is considered sattvic and stable. || 26 ||
Without refuse, supreme, pure, bestowing liberation, granting siddhis, auspicious.

# 77

Here, because everything is of the nature of consciousness-Self through the vision of offering to Brahman without blinking. || 27 ||

# 78

Therefore with all effort mental worship is constant. || 3-27 ||

# 79

It must be performed right at the outset…

Thereafter, having worshipped the line of Gurus and obtained permission, for the sake of manifesting Śiva-nature with all (rites):

# 80

…thereafter with abundant substances.

# 81

In one’s own house, in a temple, at a confluence, on a mountain peak, || 3-28 ||
in an excellent and beautiful spot marked with a lotus.

The connection is that worship must be performed — “spot” is to be connected everywhere. || 29 ||

Therein, first:

# 82

He should draw a coloured maṇḍala adorned with white lines, || 3-29 ||
with four doors, four corners, well-proportioned, beautiful,
endowed with splendour and beauty; in its centre a lunar orb, || 3-30 ||
resembling the full moon, endowed with a garland of rays;
in its centre an eight-petalled lotus, very white, resembling the moon, || 3-31 ||
endowed with variegated filaments, with an excellent golden pericarp.

# 83

The arrangement of the maṇḍala will be taught later in the Śrī-Yāga; therefore it is not detailed here. || 32 ||

Thereafter:

# 84

In its centre he should descend the Lord of lords from His own abode. || 3-32 ||

# 85

“From His own abode” means from the abode of consciousness that is the inner place of worship; he should reflect upon Him descending for the sake of grace in the form of an external image-manifestation, and place Him externally in the order of creation. || 3-33 ||

# 86

Making both hands supine, with the thumbs in the middle…

# 87

With the Āvāhanī mudrā of invitation…

# 88

he should then invite the God conceived as having three bodies. || 33 ||

# 89

He should invite from all sides; even externally, for the sake of grace, he should contemplate Him as resting upon the supports. “Three bodies” means conceived with the three — subtle and gross — bodies that are supreme, subtle, and gross, stationed in progressively encompassing relation, consisting of the essences from niṣkala onwards, though He is in reality the unequalled One.

# 90

“Through freedom He makes Himself free, through freedom He is non-dual;
the Lord creates through the resolves of Īśa etc. and transacts.” (Recognition-prakāśa 1.5.16)

# 91

According to the method taught in the Pratyabhijñā, divided into three — this is the meaning. || 3-34 ||

For the presence of the invited deity: showing the Liṅga-mudrā with raised interlocked thumbs, and for restraint the harsh mudrā with interlocked thumbs hidden, then furthermore:

# 92

He should place the Aṅgas on the petals in the order beginning with the Āgneya direction.

# 93

In the Āgneya, Īśāna, Rakṣā, and Vāyavya directions the four beginning with the Heart; in the four directions beginning with the east, the Astra; in the pericarp, the Netra.

All that:

# 94

Is to be worshipped with white offerings: flowers, garments, unguents, || 34 ||
various coloured food-offerings, well-perfumed fragrant incense,
various pleasing drinks…

# 95

Meaning: having made it well-incensed. The rest is clear. || 3-35 ||

Of the sādhaka:

# 96

…according to differences of disposition he should worship. || 35 ||

# 97

Therein:

# 98

O Beloved! For the sake of peace he should worship with all-white offerings.
For the sake of nourishment he should sacrifice with abundant mixed substances. || 3-37 ||

# 99

Mixed means having the form of white, red, etc. coverings. || 3-36 ||

Thereafter, as an auxiliary:

# 100

Thereafter he should perform homa according to the desired object.

# 101

The seeker of liberation with sesame and ghee; the seeker of enjoyment with the respective substances.

Where? He says:

# 102

In a triangular, circular, or square kuṇḍa that is beautiful, || 37 ||
finally in a kuṇḍa of one hasta…

# 103

“Finally in a kuṇḍa” refers to the ordinary homa. In the case of two or four hastas, etc., it will be taught later. || 38 ||

Of this kuṇḍa:

# 104

…with six parts the upper girdle;
the middle one with two or four (parts), the lowest with twelve parts. || 3-38 ||
In length and likewise in breadth, six in the middle, three aṅgulas at the tip.

# 105

With six parts of the hasta — with four aṅgulas — the upper girdle. The middle one with two or four (i.e., eight parts) — three aṅgulas. The lowest one of twelve parts — two aṅgulas. The excavation below is empty. The lip-girdle is the special visible part in the interval between the lips and the excavation. Like an aśvattha-leaf the navel, having the form of the yoni; the navel is the special part in front. Nine aṅgulas in length and breadth, six aṅgulas in the middle, three aṅgulas at the tip. || 3-39 ||

And this kuṇḍa:

# 106

…is prescribed for a homa of a thousand.

# 107

Meaning a thousand in number.

# 108

…double is prescribed for ten thousand. || 39 ||

# 109

Ca is for the sense of “and”. Ten thousand means ayuta. || 3-40 ||

# 110

In homa of thirty or fifty thousand, double again is prescribed;
a kuṇḍa endowed with characteristics is recommended for lakh-homa. || 40 ||

# 111

Up to thirty or fifty thousand, double — i.e., four hastas. For lakh-homa, again double — eight hastas. “Double” is like the crow’s-Eye (repetition for emphasis). Endowed with characteristics means having girdles etc. appropriate to the measure in hastas. || 3-41 ||

Furthermore:

# 112

In regular, occasional, and optional rites, for peace and nourishment — circular;
for all siddhis it is recommended; for the auspicious optional — square. || 41 ||
It is taught with the former measure; the remainder according to the difference of rites.

# 113

In regular (nitya) — perpetual; in occasional (naimittika) — at initiation, festivals, pavitraka, etc.; in optional (kāmyā) — for peace and nourishment — thus a circular kuṇḍa. But in rites for prosperity and desire — square. And that measure is according to the previously taught measure corresponding to the number of homas. In other rites for all siddhis — according to the difference of rites such as expulsion from the body, etc. The remainder means triangular, hexagonal, etc. || 3-42 ||

Thereafter:

# 114

The consecrations of that kuṇḍa must be performed with the Astra-mantra. || 42 ||

# 115

He teaches them:

# 116

Digging down, removal, throwing of pebbles, filling,
sprinkling, pounding, wiping, and smearing. || 3-43 ||

# 117

Digging — of the earth in place; removal — throwing out; throwing of pebbles — discarding gravel, charcoal, etc.; filling — filling up; after stirring, sprinkling — joining with water; pounding — pulverising hard parts; wiping — levelling the kuṇḍa; smearing — plastering with cow-dung. || 3-44 ||

These eight consecrations at the time of construction, and also of the constructed one through meditation with the Astra:

# 118

The fashioning of the kuṇḍa must be done with the Praṇava.

# 119

Fashioning — in the form of creative Śakti; sprinkling and striking also with the Astra — this will be taught immediately after. Enclosing with the Kavaca is to be supplied from “sprinkling” etc. up to “fashioning of the kuṇḍa”.

Therein:

# 120

The crossroads, the arrow-notch, the house of the Lord of Speech… || 44 ||
With the sword…

# 121

With two darbhas from east to north — the crossroads; for the sake of the nyāsa of the Lord of Speech, slightly to the east because of obtaining the centre — and because of the ca, with three facing east for the former, with one facing south — the vajra-nature; for the sake of endurance of Śiva and fire, spreading of darbhas upward in all directions — the arrow-notch, the house of the Lord of Speech — all this with the Astra. || 45 ||

# 122

…again the invitation of the Lord of Speech with the Praṇava.
Worship, O Goddess, must be performed with the three principles…

# 123

“O Lord of Speech, be present” — thus the invocation. Worship with the fourth case and namaḥ. “With the three principles” means here the Praṇava or the Mūla-mantra. || 3-45 ||

Completing the previously taught consecrations of the kuṇḍa, he says:

# 124

…sprinkling likewise. || 46 ||
Striking with the Astra, having consecrated in due order,
fashioning of the kuṇḍa in the form of creative Śakti as Kauṇḍalyā. || 3-46 ||

# 125

As Kauṇḍalyā means through the pervasion of the Śākta Kuṇḍalinī, or alternatively the sprinkling, striking, and fashioning of the kuṇḍa as kuṇḍalya are to be performed in the very yoni of the Lord of Speech. || 3-47 ||

Thereafter:

# 126

He should fashion there the fire in the form of knowledge-Śakti.

# 127

How?

# 128

Taking fire placed in a vessel, consecrated with the five consecrations… || 47 ||

# 129

He teaches those five:

# 130

Gazing etc. with the Astra, enclosing with the Kavaca,
five oblations with the Praṇava for the purification of the graveyard-consumer… || 3-48 ||
Thereafter causing the universal fire to enter, he should make it whirl three times.

# 131

From the word “etc.” — sprinkling and striking; up to this is one. Graveyard-consumer means belonging to the cremation ground; its purification is the third. Universal fire means the fire-principle that is Śiva-fire; causing it to enter. Whirling three times also with the Praṇava. || 3-49 ||

Furthermore:

# 132

Thereafter the fire in the form of the seed, the Supreme Lord Himself… || 49 ||
And the Lord of Speech who is Māyā, disturbing her in the yoni, he should contract.
Having made it circular…

# 133

At the end of “Lord of Speech” supply “meditating”; disturbing by whirling three times. Whatever principle is there, that has been shown in the Uddyota of the venerable Svacchanda. || 3-50 ||

Thereafter:

# 134

…worship of the universal fire with the Praṇava… || 50 ||
must be performed; thereafter the consecrations in that fire at its mouth.

# 135

With the very intention of causing the Śiva-fire to enter: “Oṃ namaḥ to the Śiva-fire” — thus he should perform the consecrations that are to appear at the mouth, which are worship itself. || 3-51 ||

He teaches them:

# 136

Impregnation, quickening of the male fetus, parting of the hair, and so on… || 51 ||
Fashioning of the face, going forth, fashioning of limbs and neck,
birth-rite, and likewise here going forth, fashioning of name… || 3-52 ||

# 137

Must be performed in order with the six Aṅgas beginning with the Heart.

The specification of “parting of the hair” etc. is “fashioning of the face” etc. Fashioning of the faces — non-manifestation; going forth — manifestation, fashioning of limbs and members. Here in the middle, by the word “lima” the fashioning of the regions of mouth, heart, and feet through triple pervasion is indicated. Going forth — seeing the sun. Here also worshipping the fire with the Heart-mantra and with that very one “I perform impregnation svāhā” with sesame seeds, etc. — this order is to be sought from the venerable Svacchanda and elsewhere, because this ritual is abbreviated and depends on the common tantra. The same applies hereafter. || 3-53 ||

Furthermore:

# 138

Those from the tonsure onwards that end with the rites of childhood — with one full oblation in front… || 53 ||
all those consecrations he should complete in the fire with the Mūla.

# 139

Those that belong to the end of childhood and the brahmacārin stage, such as marriage, etc. The substitution here is “I perform all the consecrations from tonsure in the fire svāhā”. || 3-54 ||

Thereafter:

# 140

The knower of the ritual should fashion there the pair — Śiva and Śakti… || 54 ||
The ladle and spoon — those two must be made firm, born from milk-trees.

# 141

The ritual will be taught later. Milk-tree means white arka etc. || 3-55 ||

Furthermore:

# 142

They are recommended for peace and nourishment, born from auspicious trees… || 55 ||

# 143

Born from aśvattha, bilva, etc. || 3-56 ||

Elsewhere according to differences of disposition they are to be made appropriate to the rite.

For Lord Amṛteśa, peace and nourishment are principally to be performed for the sādhakas here and there — thus it is said with his own throat. The rest, however, is shown by the previously indicated general rule:

# 144

The ladle measuring thirty-six aṅgulas or by the span of the forearm… || 56 ||

# 145

Eight yavas in aṅgula. By the measure of the arm means:

# 146

“The joints of arm and forearm, eight and a half; the joint is the division of the joint.
Likewise of hand and forearm the measurement continues in the same proportion”

# 147

According to the method taught by Maya, from the root of the arm to the end of the forearm. And here, “The ninth part of the length of the arrow is an aṅgula” — with one’s own aṅgula as standard, thirty-six aṅgulas — this is the distinction. || 3-57 ||

Of this (ladle):

# 148

With six-part circumference the handle rising from the bulb.

# 149

Circumference means measure of encircling. The bulb is a pot-like shape at the root, a special arrangement.

And that handle:

# 150

With four-aṅgula pedestal at the tip, four aṅgulas all around… || 57 ||
The pedestal square in form, that pedestal like a lotus-belly.

# 151

It is to be made in the middle of the handle, at the tip of which. By the word “handle” here the entire ladle that has the nature of the staff of life is meant. In its division also, of pot and handle — sixteen aṅgulas. Square means of four-unit measure. Of platform, neck, and mouth — sixteen in the upper part; thus in the middle four is the measure of the pedestal. || 3-58 ||

And thereon on the pedestal a lotus:

# 152

…two aṅgulas in length, circular… || 58 ||
With half-aṅgula height, marked with variegated designs.

# 153

For the sake of tilaka-design, leaving two aṅgulas on both sides, in the middle two aṅgulas are to be made — this is the meaning. Height means elevation. || 3-59 ||

At its tip:

# 154

The platform eight aṅgulas is to be made, square, beautiful… || 59 ||
Placed below upon the lotus…

# 155

And of this platform:

# 156

…above five aṅgulas in length.

# 157

The hollow three aṅgulas is to be made; above that circular gradually. || 3-60 ||

Above, on the back part of the eight-aṅgula platform, leaving half and half aṅgula on both sides, in the middle five aṅgulas in length and three aṅgulas downward hollow — the place for ghee — is to be made. Above that, by turning a cord it becomes circular. || 3-61 ||

Furthermore:

# 158

Adorned with tilakas of half-aṅgula measure.
And those four on the sides endowed with four corners… || 61 ||
The craftsmanship of the sculptor, various beautiful designs — that.

# 159

Of that central hollow that is circular, whatever is on the side of the platform — half-aṅgula — that, divided into three, in the middle part tilakas of half-aṅgula are to be made. Design means activity. Beautiful design means well-made leaves, etc. But “well-designed” is clear. || 3-62 ||

At the tip of the platform:

# 160

The neck one aṅgula is to be made, divided into three parts… || 62 ||

# 161

On both sides…

One aṅgula in length. In width, however, that — having divided the eight-aṅgula measure of the platform into three parts, leaving two parts on both sides, the middle three-part measure is to be made — this is the meaning. || 3-63 ||

At the tip of the one-aṅgula neck:

# 162

…likewise the mouth seven aṅgulas auspicious is to be made.
In length…

# 163

The mouth is the area for the falling of the ghee-stream. Auspicious means for the sake of beautiful design.

# 164

…on its sides eight…

# 165

That mouth, on the sides equal to the root of the platform — this is the meaning.

And of this:

# 166

…two parts are to be reduced gradually… || 63 ||

# 167

The tip of the mouth — that three parts; two parts of that on the sides.

# 168

One should turn…

# 169

Having divided the eight-aṅgula tip of the mouth into three, striking two cords on the front corners of the middle and sides, one should turn the two side parts in proportion, mark them, and then reduce those very ones, cut them. Thus the tip of the mouth becomes three parts from the eight-aṅgula measure. || 3-64 ||

Furthermore:

# 170

One should bore it according to the measure of the little finger… || 64 ||

# 171

In the middle for the falling of the ghee-stream. || 3-65 ||

And that:

# 172

Lower, even lower one should make until the interval of the tip of the mouth.

# 173

One should make the middle of the tip of the mouth a short low hole.

Of that also:

# 174

On both sides likewise beautiful variegated design is to be made… || 65 ||

# 175

He teaches the measure of the spoon:

# 176

One should make the spoon one hasta, with root-pedestal having three branches,
marked with lotuses on middle and tip pedestals, one aṅgula nicely circular at the neck… || 3-66 ||
Four aṅgulas long, with double tip well-turned,
with hollow like the joint of the thumb, one should make it cow-hoof shaped… || 3-67 ||
With the measure of the little finger, circular at each branch,
one should turn it adorned with design, with mouth filled by a karṣa… || 3-68 ||

# 177

Root-pedestal — whose arrangement is square. Whose excellent branch rising from the root-pedestal is pervaded by three with the measure of the tip of the little finger. Likewise marked with lotuses on middle and tip pedestals. And in front of the tip-pedestal at the neck one aṅgula nicely circular — nicely circular neck, this is the meaning. And of this four aṅgulas in length. Double tip means tip with two sides divided by a line in the long middle. Well-turned in proportion — beautiful. Therefore cow-hoof shaped, with hollow such that there is the joint from the middle line of the thumb to the tip. And therefore with mouth — the place of the mouth-hollow — filled by a karṣa. The hollow of the ladle does not limit the quantity of ghee. || 3-69 ||

# 178

It should be full to the measure of four palas…

# 179

He teaches the pervasion of ladle etc.:

# 180

…the ladle is Śakti, the spoon is Śiva,
the kuṇḍa is creative Śakti, the fire is knowledge-Śakti… || 69 ||

# 181

Here the supreme consecration is pervasion by non-difference from Śiva — with this intention the consecrations of ladle and spoon are not taught here. || 3-70 ||

# 182

Having thus prepared in due order, thereafter he should commence the homa.

# 183

Thus preparation means reflection through non-difference of Śiva and Śakti. In due order means according to the pervasion of power, a hundred or a thousand of the Mūla according to capacity, and a tenth of that of the Aṅgas in regular rite.

He teaches the rule of substances in optional rite:

# 184

By homa with sesame mixed with milk, with sugar and ghee… || 70 ||
great peace arises at that very moment — of this there is no doubt.

# 185

Having said this incidentally, he teaches the main subject:

# 186

First he should perform the consecrations of the ghee, thereafter the homa… || 3-71 ||

# 187

He teaches them:

# 188

Placing upon, removal, whirling, placing thereafter,
gazing with the Astra, then offering of light… || 3-72 ||
Circumambulation of the fire, likewise rising and falling,
with the Astra alone…

# 189

Pouring from vessel to vessel, placing above the fire, gazing three times around the kuṇḍa, placing in the yoni, there causing it to become supreme fire with fire, showing light in all directions with a darbha-torch, throwing the blazing darbha inside, raising three times upward with pavitra held by thumbs and ring-fingers of both hands, lowering three times — this is the nature of placing upon etc.

These nine consecrations with the Astra:

# 190

…worship with the Mūla, making into nectar likewise… || 3-73 ||

# 191

The Amṛtā-mudrā is to be shown here. || 3-74 ||

Thereafter:

# 192

He should fashion with the Astra-mantra the darbha-spread, seats, and enclosing sticks.

# 193

On the darbha-spread various ones pervaded by the Astra — seats for protection; outside encircled by the Astra-wall, one-hasta mantric branches — the enclosing sticks. These three outside the kuṇḍa.

Thereafter, having thrown two darbhas into the ghee-vessel:

# 194

He should fashion with the Praṇava the sun and moon externally… || 74 ||

# 195

Having fashioned the triple abode in the ghee with the Mūla together with Praṇava, filling the spoon in order from left, right, and middle — “To Soma svāhā”, “To Agni svāhā”, “To Agni and Soma svāhā” — by homa the fire becomes triple-aboded in the bright fortnight. In the dark fortnight, however, from the left “To Sun svāhā”, from the right “To Agni svāhā”, from the middle “To Agni and Sun svāhā” — the method taught in the Svacchanda is to be followed here. || 3-75 ||

Thereafter the fire:

# 196

He should meditate as having nine flames…

“Desiring ghee, causing burning, giver of death, remover of enemies,
causing control, causing expulsion, giver of wealth, giver of liberation,

bestowing all siddhis…”

# 197

Thus named from east onwards to the middle and end — the flames of Agni are to be fashioned with the substitution “I fashion the flames of Agni”.

# 198

…a full one he should drop with the Mūla.

# 199

Having thus consecrated kuṇḍa, fire, ladle, spoon, and ghee:

# 200

Thereafter he should worship that mantra with Aṅgas in the middle… || 75 ||

# 201

But the sādhaka:

# 202

When this has been done, he should offer the mantra according to the rite.

# 203

“When this has been done” means upon completion of the regular rite.

# 204

Therein with milk mixed with ghee lasting nourishment arises… || 3-76 ||

# 205

Of the sādhaka who has offered. || 3-77 ||

# 206

By homa with ghee and guggulu full lifespan certainly arises.

# 207

Desiring lifespan.

# 208

Desiring prosperity he should offer lotuses soaked in ghee and milk… || 77 ||
Desiring kingdom he should offer bilva fruits smeared with the three sweets.
By homa with twigs of milk-trees he obtains health. || 3-78 ||
By homa with excellent twigs in the fire born from excellent trees
he obtains all desires — truly, not otherwise. || 3-79 ||
By homa of seven rice-grains the desirer of wealth becomes possessor of wealth.

# 209

Clear. || 80 ||

Having thus taught homas yielding auspicious results, lest one belittle homa yielding results such as expulsion, he says:
For the desired object one should perform the desired homa. || 80 ||

He teaches homa appropriate to this mantra:

With milk alone by homa one certainly conquers death. || 81 ||

Because this Lord is conqueror of death — auspicious!

Victorious is He who illuminates all worlds, who divides mercy with hundreds of moon-fire-suns,
who possesses the flowing supreme nectar,
whose forehead bears the unequalled beautiful variegated tilaka of Śiva and Śakti,
whose brow-lotus eyes — victorious is the Creator of creation, dissolution, and maintenance!

Thus, on the Śrī Netra Tantra,  
in the *Netrodyota* composed by the venerable Kṣemarāja,  
who is supreme among the great Ācāryas devoted to Maheśvara,  
this concludes the third chapter:
**Method of Offering Sacrifices**
