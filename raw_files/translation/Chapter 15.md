Fifteenth Chapter
Neṭrodyotaḥ: The Illumination of the Eye

# 2

We worship the Eye of Śiva —
that blazing crimson radiance of the effulgent expanding Consciousness
which is the Self of all and everything,
which slays demons and grants complete protection everywhere.

# 3

Having thus established the supreme greatness of the King of Mantras,
and in order to determine also its power to protect,
the glorious Lord spoke:

# 4

Now I shall explain how the Lord of Mantras
becomes the cause of all-round protection,
and the exceedingly fierce incense that is declared to destroy demons. (14)

# 5

“How” (yathā) means: by the method of homa and other rites;
“exceedingly fierce” means the incense that pacifies every affliction;
I shall now teach the substance known as “rakṣoghna” (demon-slaying).
This also implies flowers and other such substances. (15-1)

For with this mantra

# 6

whatever is given after being consecrated seven times

# 7

and whoever

# 8

constantly wears it on the head
is freed from all defects. (1)

# 9

Now, revealing the names of rakṣoghna, he shows its greatness:

# 10

By Brahmā, following my own instruction,
an abhi-cāra (hostile magic) was performed against all the jealous ones
so that the host of daityas might be destroyed. (15-2)

# 11

Therefore that very mustard (sarṣapa) was proclaimed — it protects and guards from all sides.  
It guards against the envious (serṣyāṇām)—those demons filled with jealousy—  
hence, due to phonetic resemblance, it is called sarṣapa.

The jealous ones are the demons filled with envy;
it protects from those full of envy — hence sarṣapa.

# 12

When all the demons had fled and been slain, (15-3)
then, O Goddess, I declared them to be “rakṣoghna”,
famous upon the earth.

# 13

Because they slay (ghnanti) demons (rakṣās),
I proclaimed them “rakṣoghna” — famous upon the earth.

# 14

In every battle, together with the chief of the gods, (15-4)
they were appointed as slayers of the wicked
for the accomplishment of the destruction of enemies.

When their purpose was fulfilled for the gods,
they became known on earth as siddhārthaka. (15-5)
They remove pride, O Goddess, from beings of wicked mind.

# 15

Because the gods appointed them as destroyers of the wicked
for the accomplishment of their own aim (the destruction of enemies),
and when that aim of the gods was fulfilled,
they became renowned as siddhārthaka (whose purpose is accomplished).

# 16

When all beings are terrified with fear on every side, (15-6)
one should offer into fire, with angry mind,
the substance marked with the name (of the mantra)
according to the nīrājana rite, O beloved,
with the resolve to protect. (15-7)
Then the nīrājana becomes renowned
as the supreme bestower of all auspiciousness.

# 17

When beings are terrified on every side, afflicted by ādhyātmika and other defects,
according to the nīrājana rite that will be described,
nīrājana means complete illumination (rājana = shining).
This substance called sarṣapa became famous.

And this very rakṣoghna

# 18

exists powerfully conferring grace
in white and other colours according to the difference of the yugas. (15-8)

# 19

According to the difference of the Kṛta and other yugas
it functions powerfully conferring grace
in the forms white, red, yellow, and black. (9)

In that connection:

# 20

White is celebrated as bestowing everything,
red as granting kingship,
yellow is declared to protect,
black brings about the destruction of enemies. (15-9)

# 21

Thus in ancient times the difference of action depended on difference of colour. (15-10)

But now

# 22

In all four yugas, everywhere,  
only the yellow and black forms—  
known as Rāja-sarṣapa and gaura—

# 23

Rāja-sarṣapa is rājikā (black mustard), gaura is yellow (white mustard).

# 24

—the two-formed one has become hidden, O beloved. (10)

# 25

The white and red forms—these two—do not circulate nowadays,  
due to the superiority of the others. (15-11)

Having said this incidentally, he returns to the main subject:

# 26

When someone is overwhelmed by the power of death,  
afflicted by all beings,  
then one should mix white mustard with ghee, cow’s milk, and white sugar-candy, (11)
combine it with sesame seeds,
and offer it in sacrifice — it grants complete peace.

# 27

“Overwhelmed” implies the person to be aided.  
“Mix” refers to the previously mentioned sarṣapa.  
The offering here is made with the root mantra.

# 28

The excellent Rāja-sarṣapa mixed with black sesame seeds  
should be offered after being moistened three times—  
it immediately yields the fruit of universal peace.

# 29

Thrice moistened means wetted with the three sweets (honey, sugar, ghee).

# 30

Whatever of this (Rāja-sarṣapa) is consecrated with this very mantra
and placed in someone’s hand (15-13)
produces incomparable good fortune for him — of this there is no doubt.

# 31

“With this very” means with the root mantra.
The word “very” (eva) indicates that no substitution is to be imagined.
“This” means the substance Rāja-sarṣapa.

# 32

The knower of mantra who consecrates it seven times
with this mantra (15-14)
and lets it fall on someone’s head —
that person is freed from all defects.

# 33

The knower of mantra is one who knows its power — and this applies everywhere.
“Lets fall” means the sarṣapa itself.

To determine the substance previously indicated, he says:

# 34
Having first empowered the garments and the medicinal herbs with the mantra (15–15),  
or having empowered them by the mere act of touching them,  
whatever is then given to the intended victim  
will cause the malevolent being (already occupying him)  
to be utterly unable to work any harm (it becomes completely non-violent). (15–16)

# 35  
The word “vā” (or) here has the sense of “indeed, certainly.”  

Thus, once the garments or herbs have been duly empowered and given,  
those malevolent forest-beings (that had previously entered the victim)  
are utterly unable to inflict any harm whatsoever.  
That is the meaning. (15–17)

# 36

One who, for the protection of a pure-souled person,
chants it in the directions and intermediate directions,
by day or by night,
whether the person be sleeping or awake — (17)
that man remains on earth invulnerable to all beings.

# 37

Sarṣapa is understood.

He concludes:

# 38

This method of royal protection
has been revealed by me (15-18)
out of affection for you — it is most excellent,
a secret that bestows all attainments.

# 39

When a king favourable to his subjects is protected,
the whole world is protected —
hence the word “rāja” (royal) is used because of its primacy.
“Because of affection for you” refers to the desire to favour you.

Moreover:

# 40

For kings, queens, their sons,
and for twice-born and others (15-19)

# 41

the ācārya who performs it is the cause of grace for all.

# 42

The knower of mantra, whether a sādhaka or otherwise,
is always to be worshipped as Lord — (15-20)
with constant diverse honours
and manifold generous gifts.

# 43

“Performs” means protection, according to what has been and will be taught.
“Knower of mantra, sādhaka” means one whose mantra is perfected
through the worship prescribed in the scriptures.
Because he is equal to an ācārya,

# 44

“This initiation consisting in wearing (the substance)
must be given to the yogin here;
when performed, O Goddess, by one whose mantra is perfected,
it becomes perfectly accomplished.” (5.87)

# 45

Thus it is declared in the venerable Svacchanda Tantra —
therefore the ācārya must be fully satisfied in every way.

Illustrating this with the foremost example, he clarifies:

# 46

Just as the mantra joined at the end with svāhā
is praised in homa, (15-21)
so in all rites a knower of mantra who has received dakṣiṇā
always immediately bestows fruit —
granting complete peace and auspiciousness. (15-22)

# 47

“Joined at the end” means uttered with it.
Svāhā is the word svāhā.
“Who has received dakṣiṇā” means satisfied with the ritual fee.
The fruit is liberation and siddhis — similarly hereafter. (15-23)

Furthermore:

# 48

Just as sudhā (nectar) for serpents,
svadhā for the ancestors,
namaskāra for the gods,
and vauṣaṭ in rites of peace are praised, (23)
so constant gifts and supreme honour
to knowers of mantra
quickly bestow fruit and grant all attainments. (24)

# 49

Svadhā is the word svadhā. The rest is clear. (15-25)

He establishes the same truth:

# 50

Mantras abide in the energy of knowledge,
and that knowledge abides in the mind.
When that mind is worshipped and satisfied,
it always becomes sāttvic. (25)

Abiding in sattva, glorious Lakṣmīs dwell perpetually;
Lakṣmī herself abides there.
By the destruction of rajas and tamas,
mantras, when sattva arises,
become extremely pure
and quickly bestow siddhis. (15-26)

# 51

Because their dharma is to protect through reflection (manana-trāṇa),
mantras abide in the energy of knowledge — they are the essence of its power.
That knowledge which is of the nature of power abides in the mind
— the supreme mind that rests in the contemplation of that power.
When that mind is worshipped — adored with overflowing devotion —
it becomes sāttvic, blossoming with the opening glance of intense devotion.

# 52

“In the forms of the Lord’s limbs,
the knowledge and activity that belong to the Master
become, in the bound soul under Māyā’s third impulse,
sattva, rajas, and tamas.” (4.1.4)

# 53

According to the method taught in the Pratyabhijñā,
the energy of knowledge, emerging as the nature of sattva-Prakṛti,
attains the form of the rising power of knowledge.
When sattva is thus constituted,
all glorious Lakṣmīs — the great Lakṣmīs of enjoyment — abide there,
and the Lakṣmī of liberation abides there also.
Therefore, by the destruction of rajas and tamas — which contract and agitate —
and through the arising of sattva characterised by the expansion previously described,
mantras become extremely pure,
possessing the great power that is the energy of knowledge fully attained,
and always quickly bestow all siddhis.

Hence:

# 54

Therefore, with utmost effort,  
this supreme command of the Lord (15-27)
must be carefully guarded…

# 55

“With utmost effort this command” means the command that is firmly established.  
“This” refers to the instruction:  
“The ācārya must be worshipped in every possible way.”

For one who guards it with that effort

# 56

—siddhi and liberation are not far off.

# 57

They come quickly.

Concluding the meaning of the chapter and showing its esoteric nature:

# 58

The Anuttara rite must not be given to one initiated by another; (15-28)
it should be given only to one’s own initiated disciple —
otherwise it does not succeed.

# 59

Because one initiated by another remains a disciple of duality
and has not entered non-duality. Thus auspiciousness.

# 60

I take refuge in that auspicious Eye of Śaṅkara
which is the supreme nectar of fullness
unfolding through the touch and re-touch of awareness,
and which spreads every kind of good fortune.

# 61

Thus, on the Śrī Netra Tantra,  
in the *Netrodyota* composed by the venerable Kṣemarāja,  
who is supreme among the great Ācāryas devoted to Maheśvara,  
this concludes the fifteenth chapter:
**Its Protective Efficacy**
