# 1

Seventh Chapter
Neṭrodyotaḥ: The Illumination of the Eye

# 2

Filled with the wheels (cakras), supports (ādhāras), subtle targets (lakṣyas), knots (granthi), nāḍīs and so on,
With His own nectar the Lord sprinkles the body—remember the upward-gazing gaze of the Sovereign Lord!

# 3

Thereupon, to determine the subtle meditation (sūkṣma-dhyāna), the Blessed Lord spoke:

# 4

From this point onward I shall expound the unsurpassed subtle meditation.

# 5

There exists nothing higher than subtle meditation; it shall become even higher than Yourself.
Thus He begins:

# 6

The wheel of the seasons (ṛtu-cakra), the foundation of the vowels (svarādhāra), the threefold target (tri-lakṣya), the five voids (vyoma-pañcaka),
United with twelve knots (granthi-dvādaśa), endowed with the triad of energies (Śakti-traya),
Traversed by the paths of the three abodes (dhāma-traya-patha), equipped with the triad of channels (nāḍī-traya). ||6||

Knowing thus the body, O fair-hipped One, enveloped by the paths of the ten nāḍīs,
With seventy-two thousand and three and a half crores of nāḍī-clusters completely pervading it,
Defiled, surrounded by diseases—

Only by the nectar of subtle meditation, arisen from the Supreme,
Does the yogī cause nourishment (āpyāya) of his own body or that of another.
He becomes possessed of a divine body, free from all diseases. ||7-1–4||

# 7

The six seasons (ṛtu) correspond to the stations of birth (janma), navel (nābhi), heart (hṛd), palate (tālu), bindu, and nāda. They are called “wheels” (cakra) because they serve as the bases for the spread of nāḍīs, illusion (Māyā), the piercing of yoga, radiance, and peace.

The sixteen supports (ādhāra)—thumb, ankle, knee, penis, anus, kanda, navel-channel, stomach, heart, kūrma-nāḍī, throat, palate, brow-center, forehead, brahma-randhra, and the twelve-ending (Dvādaśānta)—are called “vowels” (svara) because they support the life-force (Jīva). Alternatively, because this path (naya) embraces all, it is known in the Kulaprakriyā.

# 8

Below the penis is known as Kula; in the middle is Viṣa;
At the root is declared Śākta, the awakener who initiates movement.
Above that, at four fingers’ distance, is Agni;
Below the navel, in the wind support, and in the navel itself is Ghaṭa.
In the central path between navel and heart is Sarvakāma.
In the center of the heart-lotus is Sañjīvanī.
Kūrma resides in the chest; in the throat is Lolā.
Above the lambaka is Sudhādhāra, consisting of nectar.
Rooted therein is Saumya, encircled by lunar digits.
In the brow-center, in the expanse of sky, is Vidyākamala.
Raudra rests at the base of the palate, presided over by Rudra-Śakti.
Cintāmaṇi abides at the crossroads of the four pathways.
In the center of the brahma-randhra is the Turyādhāra; at the crown is the supreme nāḍī support—subtle, awakening dense pervasion.
Thus are declared the sixteen supports…

# 9

These are the three targets—inner, outer and both forms—that must be known. Because they are devoid of covering—

# 10

“The infinite ether is called birth (janma).” (7-27)

# 11

Thus there exists the pentad of voids in the form of birth, navel, heart, bindu and nāda that will be mentioned hereafter.

# 12

“Birth-root is the knot called Māyā.” (7-22)

# 13

These knots (granthi)—called Māyā, pāśava, brahma, Viṣṇu, Rudra, īśvara, Sadāśiva, indhikā, dīpikā, bainda va, nāda and Śakti—are united with the nooses (pāśa) that cause the covering of consciousness. Endowed with the triad of energies beginning with will (icchā), they function in the domain of the desired, the known and action.

Presided over by the paths of the three abodes—moon, sun and fire—together with the left, right and middle winds. Equipped with the triad of channels—iḍā, piṅgalā and suṣumnā—as the support of wind. Also equipped with gāndhārī, hastijihvā, pūṣā, yaśasvinī, alambusā, kuhū and śaṅkhinī—thus ten channels are the paths.

Encircled and interwoven from all sides by the ten winds called Prāṇa, apāna, samanā, udāna, vyāna, nāga, kūrma, kṛkara, Devadatta and dhanañjaya. Completely pervaded by clusters of nāḍīs in the ten directions, with seventy-two thousand and three and a half crores through central and great pervasion. Defiled by the impurities of āṇava, māyīya and karma. Even for yogīs—

# 14

“By which this [body] is filled with enjoyment.”


# 15

Knowing the body—which is necessarily encompassed by this [system]—the yogī, whether for himself or another, nourishes it with the nectar of subtle meditation that has arisen from the Supreme, immediately following (the yogī’s realization) and fully manifest. He becomes free from disease and attains a divine body—thus he becomes the manifest form of the Śākta nectar of subtle meditation. ||7-5||

He now clarifies the earlier statement “Only by the nectar of subtle meditation, arisen from the Supreme”:

# 16

Whose own nature is self-experienced, self-abiding, arising from its own pervasion,
When the supreme Śakti arises of Her own accord, She abides therein and is contained in its womb—She is Śivā. ||5||

Bear Her in the middle Prāṇa, in the interval between Prāṇa and apāna, in the constant (Dhruva).
Becoming “I”, thereafter bear the mantra that abides therein, that is contained in its womb, the constant. ||7-6||

O fair-hipped One of excellent vows, by that which arises of itself, by vibration,
Producing vibration through vibration, having made that pride,
Place it in the birth-place. ||7-7||

By difference of feeling, assign it from that place to the root support (mūlādhāra).
By the practice of the needle of nāda, pierce by the subtle yoga. ||7-8||

Piercing the sixteen supports and likewise the twelve knots,
Ascending the path of the middle channel, pierce the supreme constant. ||7-9||

Having entered therein, becoming that, abiding therein, He is the all-pervading Śiva.
From the power of the agitation-free (niṣkala) that abandons all ailments, ||7-10||

Again filling by that very path the interior of the heart,
As soon as it has entered there, meditate upon the obtained elixir (rasāyana). ||7-11||

# 17

Having attained the experience of rest, cause it to flow forth from that place.

# 18

With force cause all that nectar to flow out everywhere. ||7-12||

By the differentiation of countless channels, the supreme infinite nectar,
By the yoga of infinite meditation, completely filling one’s own city (pura), ||7-13||

Thereafter becoming ageless and immortal, O Beloved, both externally and internally,
Thus everything is conquered by death through subtle meditation. ||7-14||

Thereupon he quickly attains success—truly, O Goddess, there is no other way.

# 19

“That” refers to the supreme abode, the virile energy of the Self pointed out in the first chapter. “Own nature” indicates everything without exception. “Self-experienced” means self-luminous, not an object of other valid means of knowledge.

# 20

“Of that God of gods there is no dependence upon another;
Since another depends upon Him, He is therefore autonomous.”

# 21

According to the doctrine taught in the Kāmikā, because this Blessed Lord is beyond the scope of proof, He abides in His autonomous Self alone, not elsewhere—for there exists no other distinct from Him. On the contrary, the entire universe, being pervaded by Him, can only be constituted of Him. Thus He says “arising from its own pervasion”—whose arising of pervasion is the emergence into universal form.

Of this Blessed Lord the supreme Śakti is autonomous in essence, His own, unchanging, arisen, vibrating; She abides in that very form of the Lord, not in the relation of support and supported, but in identity—hence “contained in its womb”. And therefore Śivā, because non-different from the supreme Śiva.

Having thus described the supreme form as the background that is to be illuminated, He begins to teach subtle meditation with “Bear Her…” etc.

Bear that supreme energy of consciousness in the middle Prāṇa, in the Prāṇa-Brahman called udāna stationed in suṣumnā, reflecting upon the pervasion of submerged Prāṇa and apāna as fully emerged. How? “Becoming I”—entering the plenary I-consciousness by the dissolution of the measurer-ship of body etc.

Thereafter, making the root-mantra whose energy is the pervasion to be described, which abides therein, which is contained in its womb—consisting of identity with the supreme Śakti—and therefore vibration, i.e., possessing the form of universal vibration; how? By vibration arisen of itself, without dependence upon Prāṇa etc.

Having thus grasped the essence of mantra-energy, place one’s own energy—which is that pride consisting of the uncommon wonder—as deposit in the birth-wheel, the wheel of bliss. How? By the difference of feeling—by the dissolution of the differentiated pride consisting of limited body, Prāṇa etc.

Thereafter, assign that pride to the root support, the bulb, by that very difference of feeling—make it firmly established.

Thereafter, by the needle of the Prāṇa of the Lord of mantra whose form is vibrating, rising, fully manifest, by the excellent yoga that arises therefrom, having ascending movement step by step; likewise “from subtle yoga”—by the climax of stimulation of the vibrating, rising.

Having ascended the path of the middle channel, piercing the sixteen supports previously mentioned in the Kula scripture and the twelve knots to be determined hereafter, pierce, enter the supreme constant abode of the twelve-ending.

Having entered that, from the abandonment of all bondage up to great Māyā, abiding in that very constant abode, becoming the all-pervading, eternally arisen, identified with the supreme Śakti, identical with the supreme Śiva;

Filling the middle of the heart by that very middle path issuing inward from the twelve-ending, making it throb with the spreading of supreme bliss; as soon as it has entered the heart, meditate upon that elixir whose nature is supreme bliss, that has been obtained—until rest is attained therein.

Thereafter cause that nectar surging from the heart to flow forth—make it face countless streams.

Thereafter, by that very nectar issuing through countless channels, thick with intense meditation, filling one’s own city (body) both externally and internally; thereafter with force cause all the nectar to flow out rapidly through all hair-pores, everywhere manifest—send forth an uninterrupted stream.

Thus the yogī contemplates: when everything is filled by the meditation of subtle Śākta bliss taught as the virile energy of the supreme Lord who conquers death, then he, becoming ageless and immortal, quickly attains success, attains the state of the Conqueror of Death, Bhattarāka. In this there is no room for doubt accessible to knowers. ||7-15||

Having thus taught subtle meditation according to the distinction of supports etc. in the Kaula practice resting upon the path of Śākta bliss, He now begins to teach subtle meditation according to the gross logical sequence in the Tantra practice, with distinction of supports etc., consisting of contemplation of thick waves of the nectar of complete dissolution:


# 22

Taking refuge in the birth-place, place therein the middle kālā abiding in vibration.
Having made oneself identical with That, take refuge in Kālāgni.
Having gone there, seize the energy of consciousness and deposit it right there. ||7-16||

The energy called kriyā, middle and supreme, filled by that energy,
By knowledge piercing upward through the knots according to will. ||7-17||

Resting upon the root vibration, thereafter abandoning the two vehicles,
Resort to suṣumnā flowing in the middle path. ||7-18||

Resting upon that very one, cease from the sphere of all senses.
Then, with Māyā cast away, again by knowledge upward, ||7-19||

Gradually abandoning Brahma and the other causes,
Attaining the six energies, the coiled one called Kuṇḍalinī that blocks, ||7-21||

# 23

[Verse end]

# 24

By piercing the knots beginning with Māyā, the pentad of voids beginning with the heart…

# 25

Previously, the birth-place was the bliss-sense organ; here, however, it is the kanda. There, “abiding in vibration” means immersed in Spanda. Resting upon the middle kālā—the Prāṇa-Śakti—seated on the maddened elephant-posture (mattagandha-sthāna), which shines forth through hundreds of contractions and expansions, one should enter the subtle Prāṇa-Śakti. At that moment, make the mind absorbed solely in That, fixed in contemplation of it. Then go to Kālāgni—the support at the base of the big toe—and mentally establish oneself there. In that very place, deposit the virya—the energy of consciousness seized in the kanda region—making it vivid through intense contemplation.

Thus the energy called kriyā, filled by that energy spoken of, having obtained arising, the Prāṇa-vibratory energy, supremely arisen, becomes middle—attains the navel, the centre of the entire body. How? By will, by effort of ascending through contraction; and by knowledge, by contemplation, upward by piercing the knots of ankle, knee, penis, bulb and navel—climbing those very higher stations, appropriating them as one’s own like “the earth is seized by the earth-lord who has pierced it”.

Thereafter, resting upon the root vibration—restraining the maddened elephant-posture preceded by successive expansion and contraction. This also refers to the divine instruments taught in the Svacchanda-tantra. Therefore abandoning the two vehicles, the side channels; thereafter, by the previously mentioned support of will and knowledge, fully resort to suṣumnā flowing in the middle path, the previously mentioned middle Prāṇa-Brahman-Śakti.

Resting upon that, cease from the sphere of all senses—remain with all senses turned inward. Then, with Māyā cast away—whose predominance of Prāṇa etc. has been rejected—by knowledge whose nature is light and bliss, gradually abandoning the causes Brahma etc. whose nature is creative awareness etc. stationed in heart, throat etc.; and together with the pentad of voids stationed in heart etc. by piercing the knots beginning with Māyā;

Attaining the six energies called Brahma, Viṣṇu, Rudra, Īśvara, Sadāśiva, Śiva, the coiled energy stationed above them, the blocking one whose form is the coil containing the entire universe up to the end of unmanifest and supra-unmanifest—attain the energy called samana; cease upward by knowledge, enter the state of the supreme reality unmanā. The connection is distant. “Cease” from the previous verse is also to be supplied here.

Thereupon He first teaches in order the nature of the knots etc. to be pierced:

# 26

At the root of birth is the knot called Māyā; in birth are the pāśava knots. ||7-20||

Brahma, Viṣṇu, Rudra, Īśvara and Sadāśiva—
Thus five knots stationed in the causes are declared. ||7-22||

The knot called indhikā that pacifies the two paths is Śiva.
Above it is named dīpikā, and above that again bainda va. ||7-23||

# 27

The knot called nāda is the great knot; thereafter is the knot of Śakti.

The Māyā knot at the root of birth-bliss-sense is the cause of the body’s arising as form of Māyā. The pāśava knots in the bulb are the first conceptualisation of the arising of the various nāḍīs, prāṇas etc. of bound souls because they possess contracted power of vision.

Because they block the bound soul from creatorship etc., the five knots stationed in the causes Brahma etc. in heart, throat, palate, brow-centre and forehead are blocking. Above the blocking ones—

# 28

“Indhikā, dīpikā, rocikā and mocikā upward.” (10-1226)

# 29

Thus in the glorious Svacchanda the energies of nāda and Śakti are taught; here they are spoken of as knots because they cover the light of supreme consciousness. Among them, the knot called indhikā pacifies the two paths—causes complete quiescence of the left and right vehicles touched by the blocking one; therefore it is Śiva, auspicious because it ascends the single path upward.

Above it, because it causes some light, the knot named dīpikā; even more than that, because it causes greater light, bainda va. The energy elsewhere called rocikā has the form of that knot. Above it the great knot called nāda. The two energies elsewhere called mocikā upward—whose upward one is at the end of nāda—are included here; the upward mocikā is declared the great knot called nāda. Its greatness arises from containing the knots. Thereafter is the knot of Śakti stationed in the abode of Śakti.

Since this is determined—

# 30

Piercing the twelve knots, one should enter the supreme abode. ||7-24||

# 31

In the abode whose nature is the supreme reality unmanā. ||7-25||

Here, by piercing the knots of the causes beginning with Brahma, the stations beginning with heart presided over by them, and by piercing the knot of Śakti the abode of Śakti, and above that the abodes of Vyāpinī and Śiva, are to be dissolved—He says:

# 32

Pierce the station of Brahma, likewise Viṣṇu, Rudra, Īśvara,
Sadāśiva and likewise Śakti, the station of Śiva. ||25||

# 33

At the end the word “station” is to indicate that the words Brahma etc. also refer to their stations. ||26||

Thereupon He reveals the previously mentioned pentad of voids and the six wheels:

# 34

The infinite ether is called birth; the second void is at the navel.
The third is in the heart-station; the fourth from the centre of bindu. ||26||

The fifth is declared nāda; now the sixth wheel is taught.
In the birth-named is the channel-wheel; at the navel the supreme Māyā-named. ||7-27||

In the heart is the yogī-wheel remembered; in the palate is piercing.
In bindu is the radiance-wheel; in nāda is declared peace. ||7-28||

# 35

Infinite like the infinite, because it supports the universe. Called nāda because it supports nāda. Because it causes the spreading of channels—

# 36

“In the navel-wheel is knowledge of the arrangement of the body.” (Pā. Yo. 3-25)

# 37

According to this rule, because it causes manifestation of the entire Māyā-universe, because it bestows one-pointedness of mind to yogīs, because it must be pierced by effort, because it is of the form of radiance, because it bestows peace—thus in order are the reasons beginning with the channel-wheel. These voids bestow entry into deep sleep; the wheels however are to be rejected because they cause spreading of piercing. ||7-29||

Together with them—

# 38

All those previously mentioned are to be pierced by the spear of knowledge.

# 39

The supports, knots etc. taught before. The spear of knowledge is the vibratory consciousness that is the energy of mantra.

He teaches the technique for stimulating the spear of knowledge:

# 40

Ascending the birth-support, gradually press its root. ||29||

# 41

By one-pointedness of mind and Prāṇa, supporting the bulb-region, its root—the maddened elephant-posture—gradually by practice of contraction and expansion, observing the flashing of Śakti, press so that Śakti becomes solely upward-facing. ||30||

Thereupon, incidentally, He mentions the synonyms well-known in various scriptures for the birth-support:

# 42

O fair-hipped one, hear the supreme synonyms for the birth-support:
The birth-place is called kanda, kūrma, and the fivefold station. ||7-30||

# 43

Here likewise the fish-belly; it is also called root-support.

Because it causes the arising of wind, because it is the bulb-form of the middle channel, because it is turtle-shaped, because it is the station of the five principles from earth to ether, because it vibrates like a fish-belly, because it is fundamental—thus it is called beginning with birth.

That bulb-region which is taught in the scriptures because of its great majesty—

# 44

The knower of yoga should find therein the mudrā called Khecarī. ||7-31||

O Goddess, when the Self is sealed by that mudrā,
Then it flows upward by knowledge, gradually upward. ||7-32||

# 45

Therein—vibrating in the bulb-region—Śakti; mudrā because She delights (mud), because She dissolves the nooses by piercing and melting, because She seals the supreme consciousness; Khecarī because She moves in the ether of consciousness—the yogī obtains Her. When the limited self is sealed by Her who has been obtained, i.e., has come under Her control, then by knowledge whose nature is the vibration of mantra-energy he flows, spreads upward as far as the twelve-ending. ||7-33||

He clarifies this very point:

# 46

Pierce, pierce the supreme station as far as the excellent vowel that is worshipped.
Attaining that station, the yogī becomes identified. ||33||

Attaining the agitation-free state, all-pervading, supreme Śiva.

# 47

The supreme station is the twelve-ending. “Pierce” with repetition indicates gradually. “Identified” because the entire lower path attains identity with Him. “Supreme Śiva”—not the liberated Śiva distinct as taught by the dualists.

Thereupon, repeating with half a verse the pervasion that is non-difference from supreme Śiva, He begins to teach the pervasion by the descending sequence of Śakti:

# 48

Thus becoming, make everything equal, vibrationless, arisen everywhere. ||7-34||

Thereafter Śakti proceeds, targetless, free of affliction,
Indicated solely by will, of the form of knowledge, whose nature is action. ||7-35||

She alone, by difference of feeling, abides by His difference.

# 49

“Becoming” includes the passive sense. Thereby make everything up to samana equal, identified, by ascending the twelve-ending in this manner; vibrationless, with calmed waves; arisen everywhere, having attained unity with supreme consciousness-light; having contemplated thus, established thus.

Therefrom, from the abode of the twelve-ending, targetless, whose nature is supreme vibration, Śakti who has issued forth, whose afflictions up to great Māyā have departed, proceeds, fully arises, vibrating in sequence as will, knowledge and action. Therefore She is one; by the difference of feeling of that supreme Śiva—by the cause that is the variety of arising of the to-be-desired, the to-be-known and action—She abides having assumed the manifoldness of will etc.

Since Śakti proceeds of Herself from supreme Śiva—

# 50

Filling up to the end of Śakti by Khecarī-mudrā, everywhere therein, ||7-36||

Until the moon is not aroused, so long the subtle, stainless,
Grasped by feeling, undoubted, abandoned by all states, supreme, ||7-37||

All-pervading, the abode of the Lord, incomparable, free of affliction—
Yogīs become that when they have ascended it, O fair-faced One. ||7-38||

# 51

Therein—

# 52

“Binding padmāsana, the yogī should place the navel-lotus upon the chest-lord.
Make it rod-like and lead it as far as the three ethers.
Restraining it there, swiftly impel it with the three ethers.
Binding this, the great yogī attains movement in the ether.” (7-15-17)

# 53

By the Khecarī-mudrā pointed out in the glorious Mālinīvijaya, filling up to the end of Śakti, in every way; until the moon, i.e., apāna, is not aroused therein—when they have ascended that abode of Śakti, yogīs become:

subtle (beyond senses), stainless (uncovered), grasped by feeling (self-luminous), undoubted (whose essence is self-awareness), abandoned by all waking etc. states (supreme because of the state of identity of everything), all-pervading (unlimited by direction etc.), of the Lord (autonomous), incomparable (non-dual), free of affliction (no limitation by great Māyā for devotees)—that supreme abode they become, i.e., identified with it. ||7-39||

Thus for the yogī who has attained non-difference from the supreme reality, the supreme Śakti that was said to be vibrating with “Thereafter Śakti proceeds…”—

# 54

She is the source of all gods and of energies in manifold ways.
The source that is fire-and-moon—everything proceeds from Her. ||39||

There mantras that are bound together become possessed of protection.
The dissolution of all is that very supreme abode. ||7-40||

From Her creation proceeds, agitating supreme Śiva,
Attaining the incomparable nectar, agitating bindu by play, ||7-41||

When the arising of the moon is known, then the supreme excellent nectar—
Remember there the thick waves of nectar, infinite. ||7-42||

Thereafter attaining pure nectar, draw it by one’s own Śakti,
By the middle path, O fair-hipped One, pierce the causes and the rest, ||7-43||

Perform nourishment station by station in order,
Until the Brahma-station is attained; thereafter nourish downward. ||7-44||

From the path of the birth-place cause it to proceed into the fire of time,
Filling thereby, remember the city completely full all around. ||7-45||

Contemplate the whole filled by the nectar of suṣumnā,
There by countless channels, by hair-pores all around, ||7-46||

Issuing forth, becoming all-pervading, agitated by waves of nectar,
Mounted upon the ocean of nectar, immersed in the ocean of nectar. ||7-47||

Above it the ocean of nectar, flowing swiftly, all-pervading Śiva—
Thus identified, nectar facing everywhere, ||7-48||

Of the form of will-knowledge-action, Śiva, one’s own nature,
Attaining the affliction-free, contemplate by one’s own experience. ||7-49||

Attaining the subtle station of the Lord of nectar, one becomes possessed of nectar.
Thereupon he, having become possessed of nectar, is conqueror of death—here no doubt. ||7-50||

# 55

Conqueror of time, fortunate, steadfast—death does not afflict him.

“Of all gods” means the unstationed Sadāśiva, Īśvara, Ananta, Rudra etc.; “of energies” means Vāmā, Jyeṣṭhā etc. And since that Śakti is the source that is fire-and-moon, therefore predominantly moon; since everything arises from Her, therefore the universe whose nature is fire-and-moon is solely fire-and-moon. As the knowers of reality say: fire delights, and it burns even cold. Moreover, mantras bound together therein, uttered as the essence of Her energy, become possessed of protection, bestowing success and liberation—thus the cause of maintenance by Śakti is taught. “That very” because of the fire-nature of the fire-and-moon Śakti, also the cause of dissolution.

Having thus shown that Śakti is the cause of creation, maintenance and dissolution, He returns to the subject: “From Her…” Since Śakti is of such nature, therefore agitating supreme Śiva, making Him inclined toward creation by descent to the samana station; attaining the incomparable nectar, i.e., consisting of supreme bliss; agitating bindu, i.e., the abode of great light ascended to samana, by play, by the sport of autonomy, making it inclined toward creative spreading;

When the arising of the moon, the exaltation of apāna, is known, then from that Śākta abode arises the supreme excellent nectar whose essence is the savour of bliss, thick with waves of nectar, spreading of cool pure nectar, infinite, unlimited—remember, meditate there.

Thereafter, attaining pure nectar from the arising of the moon, draw it downward by one’s own Śakti that has become inward-facing, by the middle path. Thereby pierce, sprinkle the causes Brahma etc., and by the word “etc.” everything previously mentioned—wheels, supports etc. This very nourishment is clarified by “Perform nourishment…” etc.

Until the nectar attains the Brahma-station, the heart-abode; thereafter also sprinkling downward the station below the navel, filling up to the fire of time, remember the body completely full all around. Thereafter, issuing through all hair-pores, having attained pervasion internally and externally, contemplate oneself as the supreme nectar identified with the ocean of nectar flooding all directions, adorned with the triad of energies will-knowledge-action, the form of supreme Śiva, affliction-free.

Thus by subtle meditation one conquers death, attains supreme fortune, becomes equal to the Lord of nectar. ||7-51||

He concludes:

# 56

The subtle deception of time has been revealed by Me to you. ||51||

It has never been taught by Me to anyone except you, O fond of devotees. ||7-52||

# 57

To you alone who are vowed solely to supreme grace, thus it has been revealed. ||53||

# 58

With the play of the waves of nectar surging from subtle meditation,
Flooding everything, I bow to the Eye aloft of the Great Lord.

# 59

Thus, on the Śrī Netra Tantra,  
in the *Netrodyota* composed by the venerable Kṣemarāja,  
who is supreme among the great Ācāryas devoted to Maheśvara,  
this concludes the seventh chapter:
**Its Subtle Form**
