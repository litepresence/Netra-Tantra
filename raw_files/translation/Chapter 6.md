Sixth Chapter
Neṭrodyotaḥ: The Illumination of the Eye

Amṛteśa, the great-souled one who is life for all beings—  
how he bestows siddhi in the world and acts for the welfare of humankind,

# 2

subduing the previously mentioned malefic forces, destroying untimely death,  
nourishing the body, and granting peace, fullness, and auspiciousness.

# 3

Having restated the meaning obtained in the previous chapter in order to propitiate other deities, the auspicious Goddess spoke:

# 4

O Mahādeva, I have heard of the Conqueror of Death (Mṛtyujit), who grants both siddhi and liberation.

Now I desire to hear about the triad of siddhis with which he is endowed— 5

About the great-souled Amṛteśa, the life of all beings,

How he bestows siddhi in the world and brings about the welfare of human beings,

6-1
How he subdues the wicked already mentioned, destroys untimely death,

Nourishes the body, and grants peace, fullness, prosperity, and auspiciousness. 6-2

# 5

Thus far I have heard that the Conqueror of Death, whose nature is the mantra consisting of the signified and the signifier taught in the first and second chapters, grants liberation through the regular and occasional rites taught in the third and fourth chapters, and generally bestows siddhis through the optional rites taught in the fifth chapter.

Now, however, I wish to hear how this very same Amṛteśa—the great Self, the life of the universe—bestows the terrestrial, celestial, and atmospheric siddhis; how he grants every kind of siddhi in every way throughout the world; how, in the manner described in the second chapter concerning the creation of beings, he especially benefits afflicted human beings tormented by diseases and the like. His beneficence has already been clarified by the words “previously mentioned,” etc. Peace is the cessation of defects caused by planets and the like; nourishment is the restoration of moisture to what has become dry; fullness is completeness of limbs; auspiciousness removes destitution and the like. 6-3

Thus questioned, the auspicious Lord said:

# 6

Listen! I shall now expound the supreme, most marvellous secret

By which human beings cross over the ocean of suffering into which they have plunged. 3

Those afflicted by hundreds of untimely deaths, joined to poverty,

Disturbed by mental and physical ailments, oppressed by multitudes of sins—

6-4
How all are liberated, O Beloved, from those terrible afflictions already described:

The means thereto are threefold—gross, subtle, and supreme. 6-5

# 7

“Human beings” are here addressed with utmost compassion. I shall now declare that supreme secret reality which is the Conqueror of Death, whose potency has been described, so that they may cross over and no longer partake of suffering and the like, and may abandon the terrible afflictions caused by demons and other beings. 6-6

Therein:

# 8

The gross (means) consists of worship, fire-offering, recitation, meditation, and immersion (in the deity);

Yantras for enchantment and the like—the Emperor of Mantras powerfully accomplishes (all this). 6

# 9

The Emperor of Mantras performs worship and the rest through his own potency and abides (therein). The mudrās here are those previously described. 6-7

# 10

The subtle (means) is through union with the cakras and the like,

And through the rising of the nāḍīs and kalās.

# 11

The yoga that takes place in the seven authority-centres—namely the six cakras, the sixteen ādhāras, and so forth—together with the rising of the nāḍīs through the kalās (i.e. the phases of time marked by muhūrta etc., here standing for the entire dominion of time), and by the unification of all the outer, inner, fierce, and non-fierce temporal modes taught in the Svacchanda Tantra and other scriptures:
By means of this very yoga, the sovereign Mantra (mantra-rāṭ), through the expansive radiation of its own heroic power (sva-vīrya-sphāraṇa), brings about the subtle upāya that utterly destroys diseases and all other afflictions. This is the intended meaning.

# 12

The supreme (means) is all-encompassing and bestows liberation; thus it becomes the Conqueror of Death. 7

# 13

Because the Lord who is the Conqueror of Death has the nature of the great universal mantra-potency, he is designated thus. “All-encompassing” means the supreme non-dual reality. This will be determined in the eighth chapter. 6-8

He now begins to teach the gross means:

# 14

When, O Beloved, a person is seized by the power of death and marked by time,

When death is seen approaching, then one should worship Amṛteśa to counteract it. 8

Thereafter, with all-white offerings according to the rite previously described.

# 15

Mṛtyu means untimely death; Kāla means great death. The rite is the worship and the like taught in the third chapter. 9

Thus also:

# 16

He for whose sake one worships the all-pervading Conqueror of Death,

# 17

Quickly transcends death. This is my true word, not false.

“Asau” (that person) is understood. By saying “true,” there should be no doubt here arising from the measurer that is Māyā, for certainty alone is the cause of success. 6-10

# 18

With white sugar mixed with ghee and milk-soaked sesame seeds, 10

In a fire kindled with auspicious wood such as palāśa, in a round kuṇḍa with three girdles,

One should offer oblations according to the great protective rite, pronouncing that person’s name. 6-11

Great peace swiftly arises even for one who has reached the abode of Yama.

“Auspicious” wood is palāśa and the like used as fuel for kindling.

# 19

The great protective rite is contemplation of a fortress of weapons and the like, and protection of the sacrificial pavilion from the entry of the wicked. “Pronouncing the name” means uttering it at the end of the mantra. The abode of Yama is Yama’s house. 6-12

# 20

Alternatively, with milk alone mixed with sugar, 12

By oblation one quickly conquers death—concerning the Conqueror of Death there is no doubt.

# 21

Clear. 6-13

# 22

By oblation with fragrant ghee in a fire made of milk-trees, 13

When satisfied, the Conqueror of Death destroys death—here no doubt.

# 23

For the sake of that person whose name is used—this is understood. 6-14

# 24

With cow bile (gorocanā), saffron, and milk combined,

# 25

The samidhs are fresh branches a pradeśa in length, with bark, measuring the little finger. 6-15

Sesame, rice, honey, ghee, and milk combined—

# 26

This oblation of the five nectars destroys all evil. 15

# 27

By the grace of the Emperor of Mantras. 6-16

# 28

With balls of guggulu and those smeared with the three sweets, each the size of a chickpea,

By oblation, nourishment quickly arises for one whose body is emaciated, O fair-vowed one. 16

# 29

With guggulu incense balls the size of chickpeas, smeared with the three sweets—ghee, milk, and honey—oblation brings nourishment. According to the Svacchanda teaching “vaṣaṭ is recommended for nourishment” (6.96), the vaṣaṭ class of terminations is to be used everywhere here. 6-17

# 30

When a person is seen weakened and overrun by hundreds of diseases,

Then, having enclosed his name in a box (saṃpuṭa) and recited (the mantra over it), he is released. 17

# 31

With the root mantra—this is understood. 6-18

Moreover:

# 32

Whatever mantra a knower recites enclosed in Amṛteśa (saṃpuṭa),

That quickly succeeds even for one destitute of fortune. 18

# 33

Recitation here is according to the method taught in one’s own system. 6-19

Having said this incidentally, he states the main topic:

# 34 

O Devī, Sovereign of the Gods,  
for one whose body has wasted away, the surest medicine is the mantra placed within the saṁpuṭa (i.e., enclosed between the opening and closing syllables of the vidyā).  
The moment it is bestowed, O Devī, he instantly regains fullness of flesh and strength. ‖ 19 ‖

# 35

Medicine means remedy; “mantra-box” means employed by enclosing in the mantra. 6-20

# 36

Having enclosed the individual soul stationed in the centre of the heart-lotus within the lunar disc

With the sādya letters, one strongly transcends death. 20

# 37

Enclosed by the sādya letters—OM̐ SAḤ with visarga, the seed of fire (HAUṂ), and the pranava—successively issuing outward from near the life-force. He who meditates upon the soul of himself or another placed within the lunar disc, seized in the eight directions and contemplated thus, transcends death. The word “having made” also includes the causative sense. 6-21

# 38

Having enclosed it with the sādya letters, the knower of yoga should meditate upon it in the body;

He becomes free from all diseases—here no doubt. 21

# 39

This enclosure practice is for a living body. 6-22

# 40

Meditated upon as stationed in the centre of a lotus in the milk-ocean, agitated by waves of nectar,

Blocked above and below by moons, enclosed in the sādya letters— 22

He whose soul is supremely joyful meditates upon himself or another thus;

Possessing a form filled with nectar, radiant white within and without, 6-23

Free from anxiety and effort, he is released from all diseases.

# 41

One who intensely meditates upon the body as a white lotus in the centre of the milk-ocean, seated upon a lunar disc in its pericarp, bathed by lunar nectar from above, filled within and without by overflowing waves of milk-ocean nectar of lunar radiance, supremely white, enclosed in the Emperor of Mantras according to the aforesaid method, becomes free from disease.

# 42

Mixed with saffron, saffron, and milk, 6-24

In an eight-petalled white lotus, enclosed in the centre with the sādya letters,

Surrounded by the lunar disc, even one overrun by all diseases,

Enclosed in a four-cornered city marked with the thunderbolt—

He is released, without doubt, from the torment of all diseases. 6-26

# 43

Having drawn an eight-petalled white lotus with cow go-rocanā, saffron, and milk on birch-bark or the like, the target (sādhya) is enclosed according to the aforesaid method on each petal by means of the mantra written therein; that is, the target is written in the pericarp via his name, surrounded outwardly by a sixteen-petalled lunar disc, placed in a four-cornered city marked with thunderbolts. Even one afflicted by disease is freed from the torment of all diseases. By saying “thunderbolt-bearer, marked with thunderbolt,” it teaches that one should meditate upon thunderbolts equally established (in all directions). 27

# 44

In a great cakra of sixteen spokes adorned with the sixteen vowels,

In the centre one should write the name with the mantra at the beginning and end. 6-27

Placing the Jīva within, with the letter SA in the middle, protected at the end by the final consonant,

Enclosing it on all sides with Amṛteśa on each letter. 6-28

In the centre of all the petals, placed in the lunar disc;

Outside, a double lotus in the order from KA to SA. 6-29

The mantrin should write as before, each letter enclosed with the sādya letters;

That (name) inside them, the target’s name outside, and the solar disc outside that. 6-30

Below, surround it with the city of Indra.

Mixed with white sandalwood and go-rocanā together with milk, 6-31

Having written the Emperor of Mantras, dusted with camphor powder—

This great protective rite bestows nourishment and good fortune. 6-32

# 45

This cakra, O great Goddess, one should worship with white flowers.

# 46

With all-white offerings, place it in the midst of honey. 6-33

By this very rite, in seven days one becomes Conqueror of Death.

# 47

In the pericarp of the sixteen-petalled lotus, having placed the target’s name enclosed in the mantra-box together with the Jīva of the letter SA, and having placed the letter HA of SA within it, make it protected by the final consonant KṢA stationed within and without. For each mantra, the name enclosed in Amṛteśa and surrounded by ṬHA should be written facing the central mantra in order from A and the other vowels. Outside the sixteen-petalled lotus draw a thirty-two-petalled one and therein place the thirty-two consonants from KA to SA. In them also, according to the aforesaid method, each enclosed with the sādya letters by the mantra-box; “that” means the previously placed target’s name written in the very centre; outside all this, the solar disc (i.e., ṬHA); outside that, the city of Indra, i.e., a four-cornered arrangement marked with thunderbolts. The phrase “each enclosed with the sādya letters” means the word “letter” is connected with “prati” in the sense of “immediate” (not separated). Having drawn this entire cakra with white sandalwood, go-rocanā, and milk, worshipped with white flowers, camphor, etc., placed in honey, it grants nourishment and fortune; kept in honey for seven days, it makes one Conqueror of Death. 6-34

Moreover, this very (cakra):

# 48

Should be revealed as a royal protective rite for kings. 34

In time of battle it bestows boons and removes the pride of enemies.

The nine principles from Śiva to the others, each with a lunar disc— 6-35

From the centre, in order eastward and ending with Īśa, with Amṛteśa, by the mantrin.

When overrun by hundreds of diseases or hundreds of untimely deaths, 6-36

Then it should be worshipped with white offerings or with milk and ghee,

Or with oblations of sesame or fuel soaked in milk—thus one obtains peace. 6-37

# 49

In a nine-celled diagram formed by four horizontal and four vertical lines intersecting, each cell marked with a lunar disc, beginning from the central cell and proceeding eastward in order, write the names of the nine principles—Śiva, Sadāśiva, Īśvara, Vidyā, Māyā, Kāla, Niyati, Prakṛti, Puruṣa—and with this mantra the mantrin should perform worship with white offerings, and oblation as able with milk, ghee, sesame soaked in milk, or fuel soaked in milk. Then even a body overrun by hundreds of diseases and untimely deaths regains health. 6-38

# 50

Having worshipped thus, in a pot filled with all herbs,

With an opening like a white lotus, filled with water containing jewels, 38

With the sound of all auspicious instruments, one should consecrate upon the head.

He is released, without doubt, though tormented by all diseases. 6-39

# 51

“Thus”—having contemplated and worshipped in the pot the nine principles from Śiva onward according to the aforesaid method—he who is consecrated upon the head thereby is freed even though tormented by all diseases. “With an opening like a white lotus” means whose fragrance arises from the mouth (a compound).

# 52

Having meditated constantly upon the supreme nectar, ever-risen, free from affliction,

Situated at the end of the path, drawing down the nectar from the supreme Śiva— 6-40

Possessing seventy-four nectarine supports, filled ninefold nine times,

Ever agitated by fifty (letters), endowed with six, five, and one, 6-41

Profound with the supports of Ananta, adorned with thirty-eight,

Or, for the sake of accomplishment, filled with five—thus constantly full. 6-42

He who is devoted to such meditation, the guru intent upon the mantra,

Agitating the pot with outer and inner nectar upon the head, 6-43

Standing in the state of grace, should carefully consecrate.

He is released, without doubt, from Saṃsāra that is so hard to cross. 6-44

# 53  
That nectar (amṛta) which abides at the end of the process (prakraiyānta), which reaches up to the end of the path that culminates in samana and unmanā, which is the supreme reality beyond unmanā — that nectar is eternal, ever-arisen, unobscured, of the very form of the light of pure consciousness, indestructible forever. In it there exists neither disease (āmayā) nor Māyā, because it is of such nature.  

Having meditated upon it and, through the method of complete absorption (samāveśa), having contemplated it deeply, from that very Supreme Śiva one should draw down the bliss of the Śakti which is this nectar (amṛtam iti śāktānandam). Imagining that it has descended upon the head of the disciple, one should joyously raise aloft the vessel (kalaśa) that is filled with the supreme nectar and worshipped by that mantra.  

Thus the Ācārya — who is absorbed in meditation upon the nectar of both kinds (the nectar of consciousness and the nectar of the vessel), who is devoted to the contemplation of the King of Mantras (Mālinī/Parā), and who desires to shower grace upon the disciple — should pour forth this nectar, both external and internal, upon the disciple’s head. He who is thus consecrated (abhiṣikta) certainly attains liberation (mokṣa).  

What kind of nectar is this? He (Abhinavagupta or the tradition) explains by quoting verse 4.36-39 of the fourth chapter (of some authoritative text, likely the Svacchanda-tantra or a related source): “The same thirty-six tattvas…”

# 54  
“…in each single tattva there is also the form of the thirty-six tattvas.”

# 55  
Thus, by this state (of recursive inclusion), the nectars (amṛtāni) reside in them (in each tattva). Their foundation and support is ninefold. Those which, through the nine-by-nine process beginning with the Void that has the nature of the nine (nava-nava-ātma-vyoma-vyāpy-ādi-prakriyayā), become eighty-one pads (pada = divisions/phonemic energies), by which the entire universe is filled and completely pervaded;  

which is agitated/pervaded by the fifty letters from A to KṢA;  
which is perfectly endowed with the six aṅgas (hṛdaya etc.), the five faces, and the single root (mūla-mantra); which is the complete collection of the accomplished mantras taught in the glorious Svacchanda-tantra and other sources;  

which is profound and unlimited, inwardly contemplated through the countless worlds resting upon the infinite series of supports from Kālāgni upwards;  
which is adorned with thirty-eight (or thirty-five + three) phases of the five faces;  

By these sixfold paths (ṣaḍvidhena adhvā: varṇa, mantra, tattva, bhuvana, pada, kalā) it is uninterruptedly full. Therefore its fame is supreme — its goal and purpose is the perfect accomplishment characterized by both enjoyment (bhukti) and liberation (mukti). || 6.45 ||  

Moreover, he who is consecrated by this (rite)…  

# 56

Longevity, strength, victory, splendour, steadfastness, intelligence, beauty, and prosperity—

All proceed for him…

…with excellence; that is, they flourish.

# 57

Likewise:

# 58

…for kings the highest kingdom. 45

# 59

Proceeds. 6-46

Moreover:

# 60

One afflicted by suffering becomes free from suffering; one diseased becomes free from disease;

A barren woman obtains a son; a maiden obtains a husband. 46

# 61

From the consecration with this pot, everyone obtains the desired fruit—this is the meaning. 6-47

As is said:

# 62

Whatever desires one cherishes, all those he certainly obtains.

# 63

Thus:

# 64

The greatness of consecration performed according to the rite

Has been told to you by me, O Goddess, out of desire for the welfare of creatures.

By the usage of other scriptures…

# 65

By the practice of other texts. 6-48

Thus from consecration the target:

# 66

…becomes worthy of all peace. 48

# 67

In place of “arha,” the word is “araha eśaḥ.”

Concluding this, he introduces another topic:

# 68

Thus the gross rite; now listen also to the subtle. 6-49

# 69

In this chapter the gross meditation has been taught; in the coming seventh chapter the subtle will be taught. Thus auspiciousness. 50

# 70

We bow to the vision that is Śaṅkara’s, which crushes all suffering,

Causes all prosperity to arise, and generates supreme nirvāṇa.

# 71

Thus, on the Śrī Netra Tantra,  
in the *Netrodyota* composed by the venerable Kṣemarāja,  
who is supreme among the great Ācāryas devoted to Maheśvara,  
this concludes the sixth chapter:
**Gross Form of the Divine Meditation**
