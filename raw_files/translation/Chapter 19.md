Nineteenth Chapter  
Neṭrodyotaḥ: The Illumination of the Eye

# 2
  
All the apertures of shadow (Chāyā-cchidrāṇi), the spreading of the evil Eye, and so forth—  
the moment this Illumination of the Eye flashes forth, they all perish.  
Therefore I take refuge in that Illumination of the Eye.

# 3
  
Having previously taught the conjunction of the patalas (chapters),  
and wishing to reveal the means of pacifying the evil Eye, the falling of shadows, and the like,  
the blessed Goddess spoke:

# 4
  
O Lord of lords of gods, out of desire for the welfare of living beings  
You have taught the supreme rite of Amṛteśa that protects from everything. (18)  
Now a doubt has arisen in my heart and I wish to hear its resolution:  
Mothers (mātaraḥ) always cast the evil Eye upon men. (19-1)  
Those goddesses are innumerable, endowed with immeasurable power;  
the extremely powerful Yoginīs torment through apertures of shadow. (19-2)  
They are utterly impure, exceedingly fierce, merciless, fearless, resolute,  
violent toward all creatures, and especially toward children. (19-3)  
Their number cannot be counted—tell me the remedy for them.

# 5
  
By the words “I wish to hear,” the Goddess has made the means of pacifying the evil Eye and the like the subject of inquiry.  
“Dṛṣṭipāta” means gazing with intent to harm. “Mātaraḥ” are the Mothers beginning with those who roam the earth (Bhū-caryas).  
“Chāyā” (shadow) is that which is given by women in menstruation, women who have just given birth, the extremely wicked, etc.; it becomes the cause of a noble creature being possessed by bhūtas and the like. “Chidra” (aperture) means crying in the wilderness, etc.  
“Utterly impure” = saturated with tamas. “Fierce” = of a wrathful nature. “Nistriṃśāḥ” = pitiless. “Dṛḍhāḥ” = irresistible planetary spirits, etc., born of accumulated evil karma.  
“Harmful” and “them” are a single remainder (ekaśeṣa).

The Lord also teaches the very same truth—the revelation of the reality of shadow and the like—with the following words:

# 6
  
They always practise deception in the form of shadow and deception in the form of the evil Eye. (19-4)  
O God, how many kinds of shadow are traditionally recognised?  
What is the fear of the evil Eye, and how is it warded off? (19-5)  
O Bearer of the trident, out of grace, please explain all this to me concisely.

# 7
  
Thereupon, to resolve this, the blessed Lord spoke:

# 8
  
Listen! I shall now expound the decisive knowledge concerning shadow. (19-6)

# 9
  
“And also of the evil Eye and the rest.” (19-7)

In this regard:

# 10
  
The Mothers are innumerable and infinite, extremely powerful;  
bhūtas of manifold forms are likewise infinite and of great might. (7)  
Yakṣas, Rakṣas, Piśācas, and all other violent and resolute beings—  
their number cannot be counted………

# 11
  
“Innumerable, infinite” — twofold statement because of distinction between class and individual. “Others” means planetary spirits, etc.

These very beings:

# 12
  
……are established in crores of varieties. (8)

# 13
  
Therefore I shall briefly teach the remedy for such beings

# 14
  
by which children are liberated,  
women, men, and the wives and sons of kings. (19-9)

# 15
  
From defects of shadow and the like. (19-10)

Moreover:

# 16
  
Just as the mighty ones who are devoted to sacrifice and vows,  
whose bodies are fortified by mantras and who possess immeasurable power,  
cause them to abandon…… (10)

# 17
  
“Abandon” means that bhūta-grahas and the like release the children and others they have seized.  
“Sacrifice” means those who are devoted to the worship of the Lord by offering animal oblations.

All bhūtas and the like

# 18
  
arose in former kalpas, born in thousands of births;  
they are violent everywhere, cruel, always desiring to kill. (11)  
All of them are devoted to sacrifice, ever servants of Bhairava;  
by His power they are all mighty, augmented by His splendour and strength. (19-12)  
The great ascetics satisfy them with great animal oblations.  
That form of Great Bhairava which I myself assumed at will (19-13)  
was for slaying the Daityas and for establishing the gods.

# 19
  
Violent beings sometimes engage in violence yet, being unsatisfied, desire to kill others.  
“Power” = capacity to accomplish action. “Strength” = vigour.  
“Great ascetics” = those deeply absorbed in the sacrifice of the Supreme Lord.

Here the Lord narrates the historical sequence:

# 20
  
When Indra and the other gods were at any time oppressed by all the Daityas, (19-14)
and when the Daityas had driven them away, then they praised Me,
with various hymns uttered by Brahmā and others, for their welfare.
Then I assumed that form of Great Bhairava at will  
to rout the Daityas and to establish the gods. (19-16)  
For that purpose I myself created the grahas, bhūtas, and Mothers.

# 21
  
Thereafter,

# 22  
Having vanquished that host of enemies, they—now fulfilled in their purpose—  
came into my presence, trembling from fear of annihilation, and prayed:  
“O Lord, O God of gods, Thou hast been fully gratified by us!” (19–17–18)

# 23  
When the God of gods was pleased, He said:  
“Whatever boon ye desire, that shall be granted by My grace.”

# 24  
“Make us invincible!” thus they begged. Thereupon those mighty ones were chosen by Me  
and, through the boon I bestowed, rendered unconquerable—those great warriors who entreated Me. (19–19)

# 25  
“Grant that we be unconquerable!” — thus they besought Me for the boon.  
Those very ones, imploring, were chosen by Me.

# 26  
“Be ye even as I first created you!”  
Thus did I decree. (19–20)

# 27  
When those mighty and wicked ones had received the boon,

# 28  
from that moment forth, with all their hosts  
they overran and tormented the entire universe —  
moving and unmoving, beasts, men, and gods alike. (19–21)

# 29  
And moreover:

# 30  
Some of those great-powered beings in heaven seek to slay the very gods;  
others, full of strength, slay men on every side;  
yet others slaughter creatures of every animal kind.  
Countless are they said to be, of immeasurable might and terrible fury. (19–22–23)

# 31
  
I was again praised by the gods headed by Prajāpati.

# 32
  
When

# 33
  
then I hurled down all those extremely powerful bhūtas (19-24)  
and the Mothers of terrifying form; terrified, they came to Me,  
all obedient to My command: “What shall we do?”

# 34
  
Thereafter

# 35
  
by Me, enraged, O Goddess of gods, crores of mantras, manifold,  
were descended for the destruction of the Mothers and the grahas. (19-26)  
By the glory of Śiva’s energy, possessing the nature of manana and trāṇa,

# 36
  
they were absorbed.

# 37
  
And this is fitting; thus He declares:

# 38
  
Those crores of mantras, manifold, all authoritative, (19-27)

# 39
  
were presided over by Me. Because they are all-authoritative, therefore I fashioned them thus.  
By saying this, the blessed Lord Umāpati reveals His identity with the supreme Śiva.

Now, immediately after My resolve,

# 40
  
terrified by the power of knowledge, they came to Me.

# 41
  
When

# 42
  
then I scattered them in places and waters, (19-28)  
in the ends of the directions, in empty regions………

# 43
  
meaning they were made like scattered arrows.

Then those

# 44
  
……obedient to My command,

# 45
  
remained there in that very state.

Who are they? He declares:

# 46
  
some desire offerings, others desire to enjoy;  
others desire sexual pleasure, others desire to kill;  
some are produced by vāta, some by pitta, others by kapha, some by the combination of all three;  
bhūtas of manifold forms. (19-30)

# 47
  
Those who desire to enjoy crave flesh and blood; those who desire to kill crave life itself.
They arise when vāta, etc., are aggravated. By the word “desire” their wish is indicated; yet, out of fear of Me, they do not dare act forcibly anywhere. (31)

Thereafter

# 48
  
I said to those mighty ones who remain within bounds:  
“By My commanded mantras, mudrās, and various meditations always

# 49
  
you shall exist.” (The rest is to be supplied.) (19-32)

# 50
  
When, O beloved, they hear the five streams divided,  
then all flee and run away in the ten directions. (32)

# 51
  
These very ones, by My command alone,

# 52
  
torment men and animals by many causes.

# 53
  
He reveals the causes:

# 54
  
The wicked man of evil soul, impure, the vilest of men—  
from disrespect to mother and father, from neglect of study,  
from excessive intercourse with women, and especially from intoxication; (19-34)  
from intercourse at improper times, from delusion, fear, and confusion—

# 55
  
grahas seize him (to be connected with what follows).  
“Evil conduct” = abandoning proper behaviour. “Evil soul” = devoted to harming others. “Impure” = devoid of purity of mind, wealth, and body.  
Neglect of study = abandonment of study by one authorised to study.  
Fear born of delusion = terror arising from ignorance.  
Terror caused by shadow etc., confusion in a matter that should not cause confusion.

Also those in authority

# 56
  
who abandon the twilight prayers, who indulge in intercourse and twilight worship,  
who eat, study, or sleep during the twilight hours;  
who desire unwilling women and the wives of gurus, O beloved; (19-36)  
who forcibly violate other women;  
and others who habitually speak falsehoods, who are treacherous and evil; (19-37)  
men who are associated with unmentioned sinful deeds—  
by these and other causes grahas seize men. (19-38)

# 57
  
“Unwilling” = those in whom desire has not arisen. “Habitually speak falsehood” = those for whom falsehood is natural.  
“Unmentioned” = murder of a Brahmin etc.; “other” = betrayal of friends etc. (19-39)

------------------------------------------------
And women likewise, through bad conduct, impurity, eating forbidden food,

# 58
  
through hatred of both kinds of gurus, through adultery with the husband, (39)  
and through other unmentioned faults, become polluted and are sealed by them.

# 59
  
Both kinds of gurus = father-in-law etc., and those who bestow grace. “Other” = theft of deposits etc. “Them” = the grahas.

Likewise

# 60
  
crying children, and those who stay awake at night; (19-40)  
terrified, frightened, polluted by faults;  
crying loudly, with dishevelled hair, terrible; (19-41)  
polluted merely by the touch of wicked Pukkasas and Caṇḍālas;  
polluted by touching a corpse, by going to it, by touching one who is there; (19-42)  
by association with those polluted by it, by following news of it;  
polluted by impurity and by many other evil contacts. (19-43)

# 61
  
Polluted by faults = afflicted by misfortune etc. “Terrible” = intent solely on harming.  
“One who is there” = flowers of the corpse etc.; by touching them.  
Those polluted in connection with a corpse = those authorised to play instruments etc.; by association with them.  
“News of it” = news of the corpse; following it = connection with it. (19-44)

Thus, from faults of this kind, according to circumstance, whatever women or men are polluted,

from among them

# 62
  
a wicked woman or man, after bathing, may cast a shadow  
upon the children of kings, their wives, and ascetics. (44)

# 63
  
Then by that very

# 64
  
aperture of shadow the bhūtas and extremely powerful Mothers  
cast the evil Eye; for the violent ones obtain an opening. (19-45)

# 65
  
“For the violent ones obtain an opening” is an arthāntaranyāsa (implied restatement). (19-46)

Moreover:

# 66
  
They cast a fierce glance upon children with desire to kill.  
The most sinful, of evil conduct, seized by bhūtas with fever and the like; (46)  
likewise mad, of wicked mind, of sinful behaviour, greatly afflicted;  
hungry, envious, enemies puffed up with pride; (19-47)  
these and many others cast a terrifying glance  
upon children and upon all the previously mentioned ones. (19-48)  
Knowing that the evil Eye has thus arisen, one should perform the remedial act;  
one must not delay even for a moment, for with the slightest rite performed (19-49)  
the evil ones do not torment; having remained, they do torment.

# 67
  
“The most sinful” = devoted to forbidden acts. “Of evil conduct” = whose chief trait is impropriety.
“Likewise” is to be connected with what precedes. “Of wicked mind” = of wrathful nature, etc.
“Of sinful behavior” = drunkards, fishermen, etc. “By the rite” = by śāntika and similar rites.
“Having remained” = having established a firm hold.

Because it is thus,

# 68
  
no delay should be made; one should act immediately. (50)

# 69
  
“Immediately” means “then.” “Act” means perform the countermeasure. (19-51)

In this regard:

# 70
  
With all excellent herbs accompanied by auspicious substances,  
or with the five cow-products mixed with mantra, one should cause bathing—  
bathing that produces good fortune and removes all defects and fears. (51)

# 71
  
Herbs such as Sahadevī, Bala, Aṭikā, Vīra, etc. “Cause” means perform upon the subject.

Moreover, for those who possess an evil shadow,

# 72
  
the ācārya should give a mantra-pot exactly as previously enjoined by the rule. (52)  
He gives it immediately to children and to all the previously mentioned ones.

# 73
  
Chanted according to the previously taught procedure; “and to all the previously mentioned ones” = kings etc.;  
he pours it upon the head for ablution.

# 74
  
Then it is instantly auspicious, purifying, peace-giving, and nourishing—certainly. (19-54)

# 75
  
(It) becomes (the rest is to be supplied). (19-53)

# 76
  
When innumerable Mothers present there  
desire to kill, then one should immediately worship the Great Mothers. (54)

# 77
  
------------------------------------------------
“Present there” = seen in the scriptures.  
The Mothers are those born from portions of Brahmī and the others.  
The Great Mothers are their mistresses—Brahmī and the rest.  
Thus it is said in the venerable Tantrasadbhāva:

# 78
  
Śākinī, Dūṣikā, Cumblikā, Patralekhikā,  
Ucchuṣmā, Nakradūṣī, and Ūrdhva-niḥśvāsikā,  
and likewise Adho-niḥśvāsikā—hear their actions, O beloved.

# 79
  
Among them the Śākinīs are the highest; the rest are remembered as extremely terrible.

# 80
  
She who constantly pollutes red blood of every colour  
whether the victim is walking or standing—she is remembered as Dūṣikā.  
They savour sons, friends, fathers, brothers, and children,  
kiss and drink tears—those are known as Cumblikās.  
She who always drinks nectar by approaching the face with a leaf  
is remembered as Patralekhikā, invincible and of great power.  
At night, naked, she urinates, circumambulates,  
offers blood, and, with dishevelled hair, drags—she is known as Ucchuṣmā,  
the heroine of adepts.  
She who gazes at the tip of the nose and always savours nectar  
is known as Nakradūṣī; she is Ūrdhva-niḥśvāsikā.  
She who goes naked at night to another’s house,  
covering her mouth with cloth and facing downward,  
always drinks blood—she is Adho-niḥśvāsikā.

# 81
  
Thus seven Mothers beginning with Dūṣikā, distinct from the Śākinīs, are indicated.  
In that very text their origin from portions of Brahmī and the others is stated:

# 82
  
Adhaḥśvāsā is a portion of Brahmī, Nakradūṣī of Māheśvarī;  
Dūṣikā is a portion of Viśākhya, Pārvatī of Vaiṣṇavī;  
Patralekhikā is proclaimed, Cumblikā of Caṇḍikā;  
Ūrdhva-niḥśvāsikā is known as a portion of Māhendrī, O fair-faced one;  
and Ucchuṣmā of Vārāhī, praised by heroes.

# 83
  
They are also infinite, as shown in that very text by the passage beginning “Cumblikā has three divisions,” etc. (19-55)

He indicates the Mothers who are to be worshipped:

# 84
  
Brahmī, Māheśvarī, Kaumārī, Vaiṣṇavī,  
Vārāhī, Indrāṇī, and Cāmuṇḍā—the seven Mothers. (55)  
By worshipping these seven Mothers one becomes Śiva.

# 85
  
One obtains auspiciousness. The word “bhavet” arises from the irregular use of the tiṅ-affix of the root “Bhū” (to become).

This is fitting; thus He declares:

# 86
  
They are proclaimed as the sources of the entire circle of Mothers. (19-56)  
Merely by being worshipped with separate offerings  
the entire host of Mothers instantly becomes satisfied. (19-57)

# 87
  
Therefore

# 88
  
these seven are proclaimed the chief among all Mothers.  
With white, red, yellow, and black flowers of various kinds, (58)  
with rice-milk, with rice-dishes, fish, things to lick, things to drink without remainder,  
with flesh of four kinds, and with ghastly offerings— (59)  
by worshipping them the children will instantly obtain auspiciousness.  
Rice-dishes = food mixed with rice and pulses.  
Four kinds = from marshy, aerial, aquatic, and terrestrial creatures.

# 89
  
Because

# 90
  
by the principal sacrifice the subsidiary deities  
become fully satisfied everywhere………

# 91
  
When this is done, the subject

# 92
  
……instantly obtains auspiciousness.

# 93
  
Moreover

# 94
  
From My thumb I created thirty crores (19-62)

# 95
  

# 96
  
of terrifying Vināyakas whose splendour blazes like fire.  
If any man is obstructed or overpowered by them, (19-61)  
then the Lord of Obstacles, Vināyaka, must be worshipped as the presiding deity.

# 97
  
The signs of one seized by Vināyaka:

# 98
  
“He who utters ‘huṃ’, who rubs dust on his feet,  
who constantly scratches and grinds his teeth—  
these are the signs of one seized by Vināyaka.”

# 99
  
Thus it is shown in the venerable Kriyākālaguṇottara.

Him one should worship

# 100
  
with rites of other tantras, with meditation and yoga, (19-63)  
with various coloured modakas, with ghastly offerings,  
with abundant wine and flesh, with red flowers and unguents. (19-64)

# 101
  
“Rites of another tantra” means the procedures prescribed in another scripture; here, by this very mantra together with meditation and yoga.

# 102
  
Wherever particular deities are to be worshipped,
one should present to all of them their own garments, their own forms,
gold, jewels, metals, and lamps.

# 103
  
When this is done,

# 104
  
the subject is instantly freed from obstacles—there is no doubt. (19-66)

# 105
  
Moreover

# 106
  
if a man is sealed by terrible bhūta-grahas with offerings,  
then the Lord of bhūtas must be worshipped according to the previously taught rite. (19-67)

# 107
  
In the venerable Totula a person seized by a bhūta is indicated beginning with  
“A bhūta arises swiftly, powerful, having eaten much,” etc.  
A graha is also indicated there: “Desiring offerings, desiring to enjoy, desiring to kill,  
a graha fallen upon men and non-men produces manifold states……”

# 108
  

# 109
  
“According to the previously taught rite” means with the great collection of materials beginning with the penetration of the virility of the mantra, etc.

Moreover

# 110
  
Whatever beings are surely possessed here by various Rākṣasas,  
by worshipping the Lord of Rakṣas all of them attain auspiciousness. (19-68)

# 111
  
“Possessed” = seized. And they:

# 112
  
run to every quarter, gaze at each one,  
drink liquor repeatedly, and even eat their own flesh;  
dwelling in empty villages, they become copper-coloured—  
these are the signs of one seized by a Rākṣasa-graha.

# 113
  
Thus they are indicated in the Kriyākālaguṇottara. The Lord of Rakṣas is Nirṛti. (19-69)

Moreover

# 114
  
When a man is overpowered by innumerable Yakṣas,  
then by quickly worshipping Vaiśravaṇa he attains liberation. (69)

# 115
  
The signs of those seized by Yakṣas are shown in the Totula:  
“Seized by a Yakṣa: loud laughter and the like are the signs,”

and also

# 116
  
“The glance becomes extremely fierce, he suddenly runs,  
while eating food he always worships a god;  
fond of liquor and flesh, he swallows much blood—  
these are the signs of one seized by a Yakṣa-graha.”

# 117
  

Moreover

# 118
  
When the goddesses of the eight wombs become hostile anywhere,  
then by performing the Bhairava sacrifice one attains auspiciousness. (70)

# 119
  
The “eight wombs” = the eight classes beginning with Paiśāca; goddesses born from divine wombs.

# 120
  
“The Yoginīs whose nature is the tattvas are to be known, O fair-faced one—  
following the will of Śiva, of swift mind, very powerful;  
they all roam in the worlds of Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Indra, and earth.  
Others are born from clans, born from wombs, born from clans, O beloved;  
born from pīṭhas and born from kṣetras, especially in the body.”

# 121
  
and

# 122
  
“Yoginīs born from pīṭhas are to be known; deities born from kṣetras are remembered;  
born from wombs are said to have form—their divisions are manifold.”

# 123
  
and

# 124
  
“Heroines born from the clans of Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya, Vaiśya, and Śūdra  
after twenty-seven years know that state.  
Born in another clan: Śākinīs, Mothers of Rudra.”

# 125
  
and

# 126
  
“Śākinīs, Rudra-Śākinīs, and others—Śābaras, Śivās,  
and other Yoginīs—whatever pervades the entire world;  
the vile one constantly draws and drinks the vital fluid of creatures by deception;  
having obtained it for changing form, she fells animals—  
that Śākinī is to be known, always delighting in fierce places.  
She who knows others’ minds and changes form,  
greedy for nectar—that Rudra-Śākinī is to be known.  
The Śaivīs are likewise to be known, secret in conduct, delighting in forests.  
She does not kill all, but tastes blood through an aperture—  
the other Śabarīs are to be known, their minds fixed on mantra.  
They seize all the five nectars belonging to men  
and wander the earth in an instant, making manifold forms.  
Others, through the power of yoga, know the three times;  
the Śivās are proclaimed, devoted to mantra and meditation,  
endowed with the eight qualities, knowers of the final state.”

# 127
  
Thus manifold kinds are described in the venerable Tantrasadbhāva.  
“Bhairava” because He is lord of the entire circle of powers.

In this Bhairava sacrifice

# 128
  
an inner offering must be given to all with abundant ghastly substances;  
likewise an outer offering in the field to one desiring auspiciousness. (19-71)  
Another offering in the wilderness with buffaloes, goats, etc.

# 129
  
Inner offering = naivedya. Outer = offering to the Kṣetrapāla. In the wilderness = offering to bhūtas with buffaloes, goats, rams, etc.

Moreover, here with beans, rice, fish, and other substances

# 130
  
one should make manifold offerings………

# 131
  
and

# 132
  
……present them to all………

# 133
  
to deities, Yoginīs, bhūtas, etc. (19-73)

And this

# 134
  
on the bank of a river, in a cremation ground, or in a forest, in the circle of Mothers,  
in the forenoon, at midday, in the evening, and at midnight— (73)  
offerings must be given to them; thereby they become satisfied.

# 135
  
Always

# 136
  
one should present abundant water mixed with food to them. (19-74)  
Thereby satisfied, all of them bestow every auspicious fruit  
without fail, O fair one, and protect like Mothers. (19-75)

# 137
  
He defines offering:

# 138
  
Memory, vigour, victory, increase, body, longevity, fame, happiness—  
whatever is lost, by giving it to all through offering, offering is remembered. (19-76)

# 139
  
This rite ending with offering

# 140
  
thus conquers death and must be performed for all siddhis.

# 141
  
Moreover

# 142
  
for children afflicted by Skanda-graha (19-77)  
and for women overpowered by desire-grahas,  
Kārtikeya must certainly be worshipped according to the previously taught rule. (19-78)

# 143
  
The signs of child-grahas:

# 144
  
“He delights on the lap, attached to children;  
the boy dances and always plays with dust.”

# 145
  
Thus it is stated there. The previously taught rule here is worship with mantra, archana, homa, etc. (19-79)

When this is done,

# 146
  
they quickly release—Skanda and the others who are child-grahas.

# 147
  
By the “and” even the desire-grahas of women.

Having taught this in particular, He also teaches it generally:

# 148
  
In whichever clan one is sealed or nailed by a portion of whichever deity, (79)

by the rite of that very clan one is freed from all defects.  
Whatever person is sealed or nailed by a Yoginī-bhūta-graha etc. born from a portion of whichever deity,  
who is being devoured or fixed in a village etc.—for him auspiciousness comes from worship of that very deity.

The signs of those seized by grahas born from portions of various deities are shown in the Kriyākālaguṇottara:

# 150
  
He becomes angry but not cheerful, does not desire food,
does not speak at all, sleep does not arise in him;
neither urine nor feces is passed, no impurity arises in him;
his face becomes like a lotus petal—
these are the signs of one seized by a deva-graha.
He sings, dances, is joyful, plays mouth-instruments;  
always fond of garlands and perfumes, eating only milk;  
always of loving nature, never goes to aversion—  
these are the signs of one seized by a Gandharva.  
Always fond of perfumes and flowers, eating only milk;  
red-eyed, downward gaze, does not bathe in rivers;  
he plunges into water, always delights on mountains;  
he wags his tongue and grinds his teeth—  
these are the signs of one seized by a Nāga-graha.  
“I am Viṣṇu, I am Brahmā, I am Rudra,” he declares;  
“I am Skanda, Viśākha—none equal to me exists on earth.”  
Sometimes he eats food, sometimes never eats;  
he insults gods and Brahmins—  
these are the signs of one seized by an Asura.  
Devoted to austerity and study, established in the grace of Brahmins;  
always pure, impurity never remains;  
he does not accept foul words, recites evenly with twice-born;  
he sings the Sāmaveda and utters the Ṛgveda;  
he always repeats the meaning of all the Vedas;  
he knows what is to be known and runs laughing—  
these are the signs of one seized by a Brahma-rākṣasa.

# 151
  
Thus. Having ascertained by these signs those seized by deva-grahas etc.,  
worship of Indra, king of gods, king of Gandharvas, etc., must be performed here with mantra.

Because it is thus,

# 152
  
for that purpose I have revealed every secret (19-80)  
in this tantra, and the Amṛta in the form of rite for all.

# 153
  
The secret of all those deities, even the supreme non-dual one,  
is full of mantra-power; that very Amṛta in the form of Lord of Mantras  
I have clearly revealed here by rite.

Thus

# 154
  
the Conqueror of Death, common to all tantras, has been revealed. (19-81)  
The heart of all, secret, not to be revealed, most marvellous.

# 155
  
By the previously taught method its nature as heart etc. is shown.

And this arises from the flashing forth of the supreme non-dual principle;

# 156
  
I have never been asked by anyone………

# 157
  
Therefore

# 158
  
……I have never told it to anyone. (19-82)  
The secret………

# 159
  
He gives the reason for its secrecy:

# 160
  
……the transmission of which bestows every auspicious happiness.

# 161
  
“This” means precisely that. The “ca” is used for emphasis.

Because it is thus,

# 162
  
adepts who are pleased, devoted, and worship (19-83)  
are freed from all suffering—My word is true, not false.

# 163
  
By all the observances etc.

# 164
  
with this very one the removal of all suffering of the self must be accomplished. (19-84)

# 165
  
The ācārya

# 166
  
should cause his own sons, his own wives,  
and his devoted disciples to perform it; he should not employ others otherwise. (19-85)

# 167
  
Abandoning worldly affection and greed, he should do this only for the devoted,  
or with pupils etc.; the devoted one should cause the ācārya to perform it for his own wives etc. with this very one.  
By the exclusive particle he declares the greatness of this Lord of Mantras even among other mantras.

Moreover, this rite

# 168
  
because of being guru of all āśramas, must always be performed for kings,  
their sons, and wives by one desiring their welfare. (19-86)

# 169
  
Being guru of all āśramas = protecting the people according to scripture.

This great yoga of mantras

# 170
  
must always be performed for regular, occasional, and optional rites, for the sake of peace.

# 171
  
Moreover

# 172
  
on a mouth washed daily, a tilaka of white ash  
seven times empowered must be made for removal of defects of Mothers. (19-87)

# 173
  
Moreover

# 174
  
a flower for touching or betel empowered (19-88)

# 175
  
------------------------------------------------
is given—to whomever it is given, the violent ones do not harm here.  
“Do not harm” is the meaning.

Moreover

# 176
  
the knower of mantra should empower food with this mantra. (19-89)  
Eating in the middle of both sides, he consumes nectar;  
freed from all diseases, the king remains on earth. (19-90)

# 177

Thus, whosoever, while partaking of food,  
with mind and heart streaming with the nectar of pure cit (consciousness-divine),  
contemplates and empowers that food—placed between the two lunar-solar orbs  
(at the space between the eyebrows or in the heart-cavity)—  
by the vision revealed through this very mantra,  
and by the method of sampuṭī-karaṇa (enclosing the food within the mantra as in a casket),  

such a one, while eating ordinary food, truly eats immortal nectar  
and attains the state of immortality.  

Even a king (nṛpatiḥ) becomes immortal thereby.  
The word “king” is here illustrative (upalakṣaṇam);  
it applies to any person whatsoever who practises thus.  

And the special fruit of this practice is:

# 178
  
in times of sport, together with elephants and horses,  
in all weapon-sports, for the sake of protection one should worship a pot. (19-91)  
For the sake of sport, for victory, for protection from violent ones.

# 179
  
In times of sport—on occasions of fire-sport etc.; for sport = for uninterrupted success in sport;  
together with elephants and horses—by the “and” together with ministers and country; for victory = on occasions of battle etc.;  
in all weapon-sports; for protection = for pacification of injury by weapons etc.;  
for protection from violent ones etc.—one should worship a pot with this mantra.

# 180
  
Because many wicked ones desire to kill the king and the like, (19-92)  
therefore protection must be made………

# 181
  
in the form of the previously taught pot-worship.

By thus protecting all the people who are favourable,

# 182
  
………it becomes highly auspicious, bestowing every auspiciousness.

# 183
  
(It) becomes.

Thus for a king whose head is protected on occasions of sport etc.,

# 184
  
thereafter one should worship a pot for the protection of the sleeping king. (19-93)  
Silver, mixed with herbs, smeared with sandal and aguru,  
filled with milk and water………

# 185
  
When this pot is worshipped here,

# 186
  
………one should worship the supreme Conqueror of Death (19-94)  
with all white articles—with flowers, incense, arghya, rice-milk.

# 187
  
When the Goddess is thus worshipped,

# 188
  
in front stands great Sleep, bewildering the world; (19-95)  
for the comfort of the king at night and for digestion of food etc.,  
begun by the Lord of gods after giving command—thus meditate.

# 189
  
By the God giving command, Sleep stands in front of the king at night  
for comfort and for digestion of food etc., begun—thus meditate.  
When this is done, the king

# 190
  
remains the entire night with Sleep.

# 191
  
Moreover

# 192
  
from evil dreams born of Yakṣas, Rakṣas, Piśācas, and Mothers (19-97)  
and from fears and terrors he remains liberated, happily.

# 193
  
Moreover, for the guardians of the directions

# 194  

When the water-vessel (kalasha) has been duly worshipped with arghya, flowers, and the other prescribed offerings,  
then, for the protection of the king, the Lokapālas (Guardians of the Worlds) who bear weapons  
are to be worshipped, together with their respective weapons, in the presence of the king. (19–98)

# 195
  
must be performed.

Moreover, for a certain king purified by the descent of power,

# 196
  
whatever excellent preceptor versed in knowledge constantly performs (19-99)

# 197
  
pot-worship and the like for him—

# 198
  
he obtains the previously mentioned………

# 199
  
enjoyment, liberation, etc.

And this is not impossible, because

# 200
  
………the blessed Śiva has declared.

# 201
  
Moreover

# 202
  
on all occasions one should worship Amṛteśa (19-100)  
always in the form of desire………

# 203
  
because it is the occasional deity that grants all desires.

# 204
  
………because one obtains all desires.

# 205
  
Because it has been said that it is like the wish-fulfilling gem.

He slightly expands the statement “on occasions”:

# 206
  
for protecting the people and for abundance of rice, (19-101)  
for protection of sons and wives, for increase of one’s own kingdom—  
there one should worship Indra’s form for the victory of the king. (19-102)

# 207
  
“There” = on the occasional Indra-day. For the victory of oneself the king—connection. (103)

Moreover

# 208
  
for protection of cows and Brahmins, of oneself and one’s people,  
on the great Navamī one should worship in the house with great sacrifice. (19-103)

# 209
  
When that is done,

# 210
  
he obtains the previously mentioned—longevity, health, and prosperity.

# 211
  
Moreover

# 212
  
weapon-sacrifice must be zealously performed for the sake of siddhi. (19-104)

# 213
  
on the great Navamī itself. (19-105)

When the sacrificer does thus,

# 214
  
he obtains siddhi of weapons……………
he accomplishes divine weapons by the power of mantra.

# 215
  
The king etc. obtains victory; He declares:

# 216
  
………the performer enjoys the fruit.

# 217
  
The performer = the previously mentioned sacrificer.

Moreover

# 218
  
When the king is seized by the force of death, (19-105)

# 219
  
------------------------------------------------
marked by evil omens, or the country, or his sons and the like;

# 220
  
when there is destruction of Brahmins and the rest, of the people of the region, (19-106)  
of crops beginning with rice, of fruits, roots, and water;  
in famines, epidemics, calamities, great portents; (19-107)  
then ablution must be performed for the king for the increase of the kingdom.

# 221
  
“Sons and the like”—by the etc. when portents occur to the king.  
When there is destruction of Brahmins and the rest, then with water of ablution,  
casting away all defects without remainder for the king,  
producing brilliance—must be performed.

He begins to teach that:

# 222
  
having performed worship as before, one should consecrate with a pot. (19-108)

# 223
  
How? He declares:

# 224
  
Fearless, in a solitary place at night, under an auspicious constellation and lunar mansion,  
with sounds of “Jayā” and “puṇyāha,” with Vedic and auspicious music, (19-109)  
one should consecrate the king………

# 225
  
“Solitary” = in a secret place.

Then the ācārya

# 226  

…he should offer into the fire a great number of siddhārtha grains.  

O Beloved, when the name has been ritually inscribed and consecrated according to the nīrājana rite,  
with mind fully concentrated upon the fire, he should then sprinkle a great many goats.  

For the satisfaction of the entire host of beings  
and for the protection of the king, the ministering priest—ever vigilant in his duty—performs this. (19–110–111)

# 227
  
Ablution = producing uncommon brilliance with the preliminary use of the root mantra.  
The usage “May the ablution of so-and-so be—svāhā.”  
Host of bhūtas = the multitude of Mothers, Yoginīs, and their retinues. (19-112)

Excluding rites ending with offering,

# 228
  
or according to the portion taught in augury, knowing an auspicious omen,  
presided over by the lord of Yakṣas, Śiva, Varuṇa,  
going forth by one of the north, east, northeast, or west directions—  
the ācārya who goes forth with the king facing victory bestows all siddhis. (112)

# 229
  
According to the portion of astrology or by personal knowledge of auspicious lunar mansion,  
knowing the auspicious moment of omen,  
presided over by the lord of Yakṣas etc., going forth by one of the directions—  
the ācārya who goes forth with the king facing victory bestows all siddhis. (19-113)

After ablution, for the king

# 230
  
then one should cause a house-sacrifice according to the previously taught rule,  
for seven days, O Goddess, granting siddhi with abundant homa. (113)

# 231
  
“With abundant homa” = instrumental case for association. (19-114)

For whatever purpose this sacrifice is performed,

# 232
  
the immovable Mahālakṣmī or the desired kingdom

# 233
  
becomes his.

And he

# 234
  
the king, happy, obtains earthly and heavenly siddhis. (114)

# 235
  
When

# 236
  
then the renowned ablution is the supreme bestower of all auspiciousness.

# 237
  
Moreover all this

# 238
  
removes the previously mentioned defects, O Goddess—there is no doubt. (19-115)

# 239
  
This Lord of Mantras

# 240
  
should be worshipped among cows; therefore the herd of cows always increases.

# 241
  
There

# 242
  
vermilion or red ochre, empowered by the mantra-knower, (19-116)  
should be applied to cows for protection, above the horns—conqueror of all defects.

# 243
  
Moreover

# 244
  
for protection of horses one should worship according to the previously taught rule. (19-117)

# 245
  
There

# 246
  
having empowered a pot, one should pour it upon their backs;  
white mustard empowered by mantra-japa should be made on the throat or head. (19-118)

# 247
  
In the same way

# 248
  
it protects elephants freed from all defects.

# 249
  
White mustard empowered.

Moreover

# 250
  
thus protection should be performed for all animals beginning with goats, (19-119)  
always to be employed for the king among all creatures connected with him.

# 251
  
When this is done,

# 252
  
great peace arises for them; famine perishes instantly. (19-120)

# 253
  
Moreover

# 254
  
in all great fears—earthquakes, falling of meteors,  
excessive rain, drought, fear of rats and the like; (19-121)  
flowers blooming out of season, gods destroyed or broken;  
fevers, spiders, and other defects, and untimely death; (19-122)  
various sufferings, when the circle is seized;  
whatever ritual defects, defects of grahas that have come; (19-123)  
disappearance that has arisen, defect of mantra that has come;  
defects of poison from snakes and the like, eruptions from insects, etc.; (19-124)  
disorders of vāta, pitta, and kapha everywhere;  
piles, Eye-diseases, and herpes etc.; (19-125)

# 255
  
Other diseases, defects arising from wounds, etc., by the thousands;

# 256
  
internal diseases and sorrows that destroy the mind; (126)  
when people are cursed by gods etc. or Brahmins and the like—  
then sacrifice as before must be performed for the sake of peace. (127)

# 257
  
“Destroyed” = by fire, etc.; “broken” = cracked.
“When the region is afflicted” = this is the connection.
Ritual defects = sufferings born of unrighteous deeds.
Disappearance = sin arising from offense to deity or guru.
Defect of mantra = flaw arising from improper observance in mantra-worship.
As stated elsewhere: “I see no other defect in the mantra-practitioner
than that, unlike a steadfast practitioner, he merely wavers.”

Moreover, of this king of mantras

# 258
  
daily homa must be performed by the ācārya for increase of the kingdom.

# 259
  

When this is done by the king,

# 260
  
the kingdom is enjoyed happily—no deliberation is needed here. (128)

# 261
  
Because

# 262
  
by mere worship once the violent ones and the like perish;  
the ten directions flee, destroyed, like deer before a lion. (19-129)

# 263
  
Moreover, from constant practice of this mantra-worship

# 264
  
poverty perishes from the clan.

# 265
  
Moreover

# 266
  
in whatever country and at whatever time the mantra-knower always resides, (19-130)  
calamities, diseases, mechanical devices of others, or his grahas;  
various Śākinīs, Yakṣas, Piśācas, Rākṣasas; (19-131)  
child-grahas, eruptions, and other Vyantaras—  
all kinds of poison, famine, torment by grahas (19-132)

# 267
  
cannot prevail there through the presence of the mantra-knower.  
Mechanical devices = yantras projected by others. Vyantaras = ghouls.

Therefore such an ācārya

# 268
  
is always to be worshipped by all creatures and by kings. (19-133)

# 269
  
He

# 270
  
if worshipped with gifts, honour, and unparalleled reverence,  
merely by being worshipped makes all mantras bestow happiness there;  
one should worship those who regard him.

# 271
  
“There” = where the excellent ācārya is worshipped.

And because

# 272
  
grahas that break everywhere torment the adept, (19-135)  
therefore water and rice must always be given to grahas.

# 273
  
Water and rice = meaning.

When this is done,

# 274
  
pleased grahas become satisfied; satisfied, they do not torment. (19-136)

# 275
  
When grahas are adverse,

# 276
  
then protection must be performed by the great-souled preceptor.

# 277
  
Thereupon, to determine the true nature of protection, the blessed Goddess spoke:

# 278
  
You have taught protection, O God, out of compassion for creatures. (19-137)  
What kind is it said to be, for whom is it performed, and how?

# 279
  
He expands the questions concerning nature, object, and manner:

# 280
  
The Puruṣa is proclaimed all-pervading, formless, of all embodied beings; (19-138)  
He who has a body dwells outwardly and inwardly, without qualities, bodiless.

# 281
  
That Puruṣa who has a body—because He is formless, dwelling outwardly and inwardly, all-pervading,  
devoid of qualities such as sattva, in reality bodiless—

# 282
  
how then is protection performed for Him, and from what is He to be protected? (19-139)

# 283
  
Because the eternal, all-pervading, single, conscious, partless One cannot be subject to harm or protection. (140)

Now, it is not the Self that is protected but the body; even there He declares:

# 284
  
Or how is the gross body to be protected?  
It is formed from the five great elements—surely it perishes. (19-140)

# 285
  
Even though gross and therefore worthy of protection, being produced from the five great elements it inevitably perishes—hence it cannot be protected.  
Nor is there a third thing to be protected—how, from what, by whom would it be protected? Thus He declares:

# 286
  
Or is a third thing to be protected? From what, how, O Lord?  
From what must it be protected, and by whom? Tell me, O Bearer of the trident. (19-141)

# 287
  
------------------------------------------------
How, by what means; from what, from a cause of fear; by whom, by what cause—such is the meaning here. (142)

# 288
  
Explain all this completely—what, O Lord, is protection in its essence?

# 289
  
“This” = the object and manner of protection; what protection is in its true nature—such is the meaning.

To resolve this, the blessed Lord spoke:

# 290
  
Listen, O Goddess, to the supreme question never asked of Me by gods or demons, (19-143)

# 291
  

# 292
  
nor by Gāruḍa and the others, nor by many sages and disciples.

# 293
  
To be asked = the nature of protection that should be inquired into—I have never been asked by anyone.  
Listen to this reality—hereby the Goddess’s knowledge of the truth is praised.

That reality which You have asked

# 294
  
today I shall expound to You—listen, O wide-eyed one. (19-142)

# 295
  
First He begins to determine the true nature of protection:

# 296
  
The Puruṣa is all-pervading, subtle, without qualities, inactive, unmoving.

# 297
  
Therefore He is not worthy of protection.

# 298
  
But there are the subtle āṇava, the karma, and the māyiya—three impurities. (19-144)

# 299
  
These exist for Him. (19-145)

Therefore

# 300
  
because of connection with them He is impure, though independent; powerless,  
impure—therefore from the obstruction of the three impurities. (145)

# 301
  
Because from the obstruction of the three impurities He is impure; hence, enveloped by impurities beginning with kalā,  
impure; because of karma-impurity, not independent; because of āṇava impurity, powerless—  
devoid of knowledge and agency. (19-146)

How can these impurities adhere to Him who is pure consciousness? He declares:

# 302
  
Or how, being pure, does He become attached to enjoyments………

# 303
  
How can a mass of complete consciousness and bliss, pure, have desire for impure enjoyments?  
Only for one who considers himself incomplete because of the āṇava impurity aroused by the power of Māyā does the desire whose nature is the rāga-tattva arise—“may I have something.”  
Otherwise here

# 304
  
………this is contradicted.

# 305
  
The attachment to enjoyments of the pure one.

He clarifies this:

# 306
  
The pure cannot be an enjoyer………

# 307
  
Because

………alternation alone is called enjoyment. (146)

# 308
  
Mere alternation is the round of existence………

# 309
  
For the pure mass of consciousness and bliss, enjoyment whose essence is the experience of pleasure and pain, whose true nature is alternation, and the state of Saṃsāra cannot logically arise.  
As stated elsewhere: “If the Self were not impure, what would cause attachment to enjoyment?”

Because the essence of Saṃsāra is enjoyment, it is illogical for the pure;

# 310
  
………the Saṃsāra of the bound soul is constant.  
And for the saṃsārin bound, purity is illogical. (19-147)

# 311
  
The bound soul = the limited one contracted by āṇava impurity.  
Saṃsāra = going from one enjoyment to another.  
Of the saṃsārin = one brought to the state of Saṃsāra by the supreme Lord’s power. (19-148)

Because it is thus,

# 312
  
this āṇava impurity is subtle; it is logically established as effect—  
hence desire is the cause that impels toward enjoyments. (148)

# 313
  
From desire whose nature is rāga-tattva

# 314
  
the incomplete-self-consideration whose form is cause and effect is inferred as the soul.  
But what is stated in the venerable Svacchanda-tantra: “Here desire is the impurity” (4-105)—

# 315

there the āṇava impurity is intended which is the incomplete-self-consideration desiring non-karmic objects, whose nature is the rāga-tattva of non-aversion, object of specific and general desire.  
“Toward enjoyments etc.”—by the etc. even in the Sāṃkhya and other views of tattvas.

Having determined the āṇava, He now determines the other two:

# 316
  
The karma which is the cause of enjoyment arises from place, time, and body;  
what is from kalā to earth the wise know as the effect of Māyā. (149)

# 317
  
Enjoyment = consciousness of pleasure etc.; that whose cause it is—that is the karma impurity;  
it arises from previous place, time, and body;  
what is the thirty tattvas from kalā to earth is the Māyā impurity called effect of Māyā. (19-150)

He connects this to the subject:

# 318
  
Thus the limited soul saṃsāras in Saṃsāra endowed with the three impurities—  
like a silkworm that firmly envelops itself with its cocoon. (150)  
By that enveloping He is able to envelop Himself likewise with the cage of bonds.

# 319
  
The soul envelops itself—like the silkworm—with its own power;  
not by being obstructed by a separate substantial beginningless impurity-power.  
This has been determined by us at the end of the fifth chapter of the Svacchandoddyota.

Therefore Him

# 320
  
as long as the capable Lord God does not grace, (151)

# 321
  
------------------------------------------------
so long the bound soul remains concealed by the concealment of his own power.  
As long as the supreme Lord, whose limited state is manifested by the concealment of His own Māyā-power,  
does not grace the limited state by the expansion of His own power,  
so long the bound soul remains concealed by the concealment of his own Māyā-power.

Here He refutes the view of those who deny Īśvara, after raising the objection:

# 322
  
But if there is no independent Lord, the entire world is autonomous— (19-152)

# 323
  
desired by Buddhists, Mīmāṃsakas, Sāṃkhyas, etc. (19-153)

Then

# 324
  
there would be no regularity of causes………

# 325
  
In the asat-kārya-vāda view anything could arise from anything or from nothing because the nature of the existent would belong to the non-existent—  
hence the observed regularity of causes would not exist.  
“That which is seen immediately after is its cause”—this is logical only in the view that things remain in their own form without depending on another.  
Even if resting in the Self, the variety of ripening etc. of subtle actions which are mere residues and their capacity to produce fruits cannot occur without the superintendence of Īśvara.  
Even in the sat-kārya-vāda view everything would exist everywhere, nothing would be a cause anywhere;  
manifestation etc. would belong to the non-existent or have a non-existent cause—asat-kārya-vāda;  
even in the avidyā-vāda, if Brahmā is not agent and avidyā is unreal, the variety of the world cannot occur;  
if the apparent is accepted as non-unreal, then merely by acceptance the unreal world would have the unreal as cause—  
this is illogical; hence without the power of the all-pervading, pure, conscious supreme Lord  
there would be no regularity of causes.

Therefore

# 326
  
………it would be illogical.

# 327
  
Everything would exist—rest to be supplied.

He fits the subject by way of illustrations:

# 328
  
As a certain ox is bound by rope-binding, (153)  
joined to enjoyments like grass—so the bound soul is not independent.

# 329
  
Rope = āṇava etc. Like an ox the bound soul is bound by ropes,  
not independent, joined to enjoyments like grass.

Therefore

# 330
  
there is some supreme releaser of the grasped that is capable, seen—  
likewise the gracious Lord who accomplishes all,  
Śiva augmented by His own power, gracious to all. (19-154 & 19-156)

# 331
  
“Of the grasped” = of one bound by rope; the releaser of rope, just as some supreme capable one is seen,  
not everyone—so likewise the all-accomplishing Lord Viṣṇu, the capable Śiva,  
augmented by His own power whose nature is independence,  
is gracious to all. (19-155)

By which power He is augmented—

# 332
  
that power is never separated from Him, like His own ray from the sun.

# 333

Moreover

# 334
  
heat is never separated from fire that burns and illumines. (156)

# 335
  
Just as

# 336
  
so the power of the Lord, never separated, whose nature is Śiva,  
the sole cause of the universe, the Goddess, standing as many.

# 337
  
He clarifies the manifoldness:

# 338
  
in the form of will, knowledge, and action she functions by difference of activity.

# 339
  
Because of being the non-sequential and sequential and non-sequential and sequential revealer of the universe—  
the single power of freedom functions in the threefold form of icchā, jñāna, and kriyā.

Therefore

# 340
  
the non-terrifying is will that desires non-duality, all-pervading, all-containing; (19-158)  
the terrifying is knowledge, she who functions by grasping;  
another, more terrifying than the terrifying, is the disturbing action-power. (19-159)

# 341
  
That whose “terrifying” (difference-touching form) does not exist—  
that non-terrifying supreme will is inclined toward grace,  
whose nature is the non-dual light of the entire non-sequential universe,  
therefore all-pervading, all-containing, non-different from Śiva.  
The terrifying is the mediate, manifesting difference and non-difference,  
therefore by grasping all around she functions in the universe on her own ground  
as if separate though not separate from herself.  
More terrifying than the terrifying, manifesting clear difference of the universe,  
therefore the disturbing, arousing impurity of grasped and grasper—the inferior form.

She who thus reveals non-duality, duality-non-duality, and duality—  
will, knowledge, and action—one alone,  
called by names such as Mātṛsadbhāva in the scriptures,

# 342
  
she is the protection of all beings, all-protection, supreme protector.

# 343
  
When recognised through the descent of power she protects from all states of Saṃsāra—  
hence she herself, called by that name, is the true, supreme protection.

This is fitting; thus He declares:

# 344
  
and that is proclaimed as initiation, characterised by giving and destroying. (160)

# 345
  
------------------------------------------------
The “ca” is for emphasis. Giving = manifestation of Śiva-nature; destroying = of the bonds.

# 346
  
In this very way she removes all defects;  
for the all-pervading existent Puruṣa this protection does not contradict. (161)

# 347
  
“In this very way” = in the form of initiation characterised by giving and destroying.  
Does not contradict = because it reveals the nature of the all-pervading limited soul. (19-162)

Moreover

# 348
  
I shall teach another all-protecting protection.

# 349
  
First indicating its subject He declares it:

# 350
  
From obstruction by the three impurities arises the dawn of manifold karmic fruits; (162)  
from that the sense-organs function toward objects beginning with sound.  
Dwelling in the middle of the heart-lotus, impeller of dharma and adharma; (19-163)  
overpowered by attachment and aversion, enveloped by the threefold inner organ;  
bound to effects and causes, united with the elements by the organs; (19-164)  
bound hundreds and thousands of times by pure consciousness-impurity alone;  
by hundreds of effects of do’s and don’ts impelled by dharma and adharma; (19-165)  
whose innate consciousness is completely obscured—he is called the individual soul.  
His protection is proclaimed by Śiva, the supreme Self,  
with manifold mantras, with meditations, yantras, and tantras.  
That is proclaimed as the protection of the soul—the great Māheśvarī action-power. (19-167)

# 351
  
He who, enveloped by the three impurities, has the arising (dawn) of manifold karmic fruits—portions of consciousness of pleasure etc.—  
from that cause the sense-organs that remedy enjoyment—eyes etc.—function with intense attachment toward objects beginning with sound;  
and though dwelling in the heart, he impels dharma and adharma only through the activity of the senses;  
hence overpowered by attachment and aversion that follow pleasure and pain;  
subject to the inner organ—intellect etc. whose functions are determination etc.;  
bound to effects (forms etc.) and causes (intellect, ego, tanmātras in the causal aggregate);  
likewise completely bound by the thirteen organs united with the elements beginning with earth,  
brought to the state of gross body and puryaṣṭaka;  
thus by all this whose form is the appearance of objects, by pure consciousness-impurity in the form of hundreds of desire-activities,  
and by hundreds of activities of speech, intellect, and body impelling countless dharma and adharma of do’s and don’ts—  
whose innate natural consciousness of knowledge and agency is completely obscured and reduced to the state of void etc.—  
he is called the individual soul.  
And the supreme Self Śiva has proclaimed the protection of that soul—  
the puryaṣṭaka-consciousness soul—by the great Māheśvarī action-power  
in the form of manifold mantra-tantra practices by which he is protected. (19-168)

Moreover

# 352
  
another, the third protection, protector of the body

# 353
  
from all great fears………

# 354
  
………by bhūtas, Yakṣas, grahas, and the like; (168)  
by Ḍākinīs, Ḍāmarikās, sisters, Mothers,  
Śākinīs, Yoginīs, and Mukhamaṇḍitikās and the like; (19-169)  
whatever fear is surely produced by manifold violent ones without remainder—  
its pacifier is called the power-protection. (19-170)

# 355
  
Mukhamaṇḍitikās = particular bhūtas; by the etc. Nṛsiṃha and the like.  
Power = the very action-power. The rest is mostly explained before.

Therefore

# 356
  
this body produced by bhūtas, impure, impermanent, non-eternal,  
formed by disorders of vāta, pitta, kapha, and their combination; (19-171)  
polluted by countless defects—  
that many violent ones of evil mind torment. (19-172)  
Produced by vāta, pitta, kapha, and combination;  
desiring to enjoy, desiring sexual pleasure, desiring to kill, and others; (19-173)  
many desiring offerings, violent toward children and animals.  
Approaching the seat of vāta, the vāta-produced arise; (19-174)  
they disturb their own seat; likewise the pitta-produced the pitta-seat;  
the kapha-produced their own seat; all seats the combination-produced— (19-

# 357  
(Verse 176)

# 358  
They rage and seek to destroy the body;  
therefore, precisely for the sake of protecting that body,  
protection has been ordained by Lord Śiva Himself  
through the united power of mantra, herbs, and ritual acts. (19–175)

The protection that bestows Śiva’s own nature must be performed daily;  
it is the giver of Śiva-hood, ever-remover of all that is inauspicious.  

For this body is impure from birth among created beings,  
impermanent, subject to decay, transient,  
changing at every instant, afflicted by disorders of wind, bile, and phlegm;  
in all living creatures this body is utterly wretched.  
Moreover, countless violent beings seek to harm it —  
the spirits born of wind and the rest, mad with frenzy.  

As it is said in the Kriyā-Kāla-guṇottara:

# 360  
“Those arising from wind, from bile,  
from phlegm, and from the confluence of all three…”

# 361  
Having thus begun,

# 362  
“He who ever delights in perfumes and garlands,  
who has taken abode in the seat of wind,  
torments constantly with thirst and speaks with piercing sharpness;  
he brings perpetual sleep yet eats both day and night —  
by these signs know him dwelling in the seat of bile.  

He who is ever drowsy, who emits foam,  
whose mind is fixed only on what should not be eaten —  
know him to dwell in the seat of phlegm.  

Relying upon the three doṣas, he displays manifold forms;  
that madness born of their combined action is incurable  
and must be known as the sānni-pātika frenzy.”

# 363  
Thus do they rage and derange the body.  
Precisely because this is so, the body must be guarded  
by the protection already described —  
that protection which has been declared as the bringer of supreme auspiciousness,  
the embodiment of the Highest Good, and the pacifier of all that is inauspicious.

And furthermore:

# 364  
Those beings who crave offerings must be satisfied, O Beloved,  
with offerings and with the flesh of goats. (19–177)

# 365  
The signs of one possessed by a being that craves offerings are these:

# 366  
“He who becomes greatly agitated and looks all around,  
in whom fever, burning pain, colic, and headache arise,  
who is ravenous with hunger or tormented by thirst,  
and who cries out ‘Give! Give!’ —  
know him to be one who craves offerings…”

# 367
  
Thus it is stated there. (19-178)

# 368
  
Those desiring to enjoy desire to kill………

# 369
  
Their signs also:

# 370
  
“He whose eyes are red, who is joyful and speaks—  
such is the sign of one whose graha desires to enjoy.”

# 371
  
Thus it is stated there.

These

# 372
  
………perish through union with mantra—

# 373
  
they perish through striking with water empowered by mantra etc.

# 374
  
Those desiring sexual pleasure are to be expelled by the graced mantra-knower  
with all tantras and herbs through union with mantra. (178)

# 375
  
Their signs also there:

# 376
  
“Always fond of bathing, pure, becomes agitated;  
always speaks first, begs for enjoyment;  
delights in garlands and perfumes, desires garments and ornaments;  
always sweet-speaking, causes obstruction,  
delights in women’s bodies and is thrilled by various ones.”

# 377
  
Thus it is stated.

# 378
  
Those proclaimed as desiring to kill are difficult to overpower, of great power. (19-179)

# 379
  
Their signs also there:

# 380
  
“He who shakes his hair and looks at the physician—  
one desiring to kill………………………”

# 381
  
and

# 382
  
“He would enter fire, fall into water,  
fall to the ground through carelessness, dances and weeps—  
these are the signs of one seized by a graha desiring to kill.”

Thus the signs are stated. Difficult to overpower = mighty, hard to bear. (19-180)

# 383
  
Although such,

# 384
  
by the supreme Lord through the power of mantra-splendour,  
by the glory of Śiva’s power they perish here—there is no doubt. (180)  
The glory of Śiva’s power = obedience to His command. (19-181)

# 385
  
He concludes the incidental topic:

Thus, in brief, has been taught the definitive knowledge concerning bhūtas.
For the welfare of living beings, the detailed exposition is given elsewhere.

Therein is much, beginning with:

# 386
  
“Therefore with water purified by mantra, touching the secret, one should say:  
‘Speak the truth, O secret one—  
who are you, for what reason have you seized this man?  
What worship is performed for you? Speak the truth—what do you desire?’  
Thus say to him always, remembering Rudra’s command.  
Having screened with a cloth, extend the left hand secretly  
and he will indicate the truth by contraction.”

# 387
  

# 388
  
When protection is thus performed—well understood and well executed—
otherwise it leads to self-destruction; this the yogin must understand. (19-182)

# 389
  
------------------------------------------------
“Thus” = from the nature of pervasion by the supreme power etc.,  
from the aspects of all-protection, soul-protection, body-protection,  
from the practices of offering-rite, mantra-tantra-yoga etc.—  
protection that is thoroughly known in this way and performed is well-accomplished. (19-183)

Moreover

# 390
  
protection is manifold, to be performed according to scriptural injunction.

# 391
  
Therein

# 392
  
the first is protection of the foundation, the second protection of the seed; (183)  
the third protection of the embryo, the fourth at the time of delivery;  
the fifth protection of the woman in childbed, the sixth after bathing here; (19-184)  
the seventh of children is proclaimed, the eighth of men.

# 393
  
He will now expound

# 394
  
those divisions beginning with foundation etc., O beloved. (19-185)  
I shall expound correctly, I shall explain.

# 395
  
Therein

# 396
  
the supreme protection of father and mother must be performed by knowers of the truth.

# 397
  
Because everything depends on them.

Here the reason:

# 398
  
A man deeply touched by defects—violent ones arise for him; (186)  
they torment him who is to be protected for the sake of continuity, zealously.

# 399
  
Defects = previous ones taught—attachment, aversion, lack of courtesy, etc.;  
deeply touched = almost touched by them—every man.  
Hence the previously taught violent ones arise for him and torment him.  
Therefore he, the man, must be protected for the sake of continuity, for procreation.

Moreover, precisely because touched by defects

# 400
  
when a woman is sealed by bhūtas, then conception does not occur. (19-187)  
Thus the first protection called foundation-protection is proclaimed.

# 401
  
Thus the first protection is proclaimed as Ādhāra-rakṣā (protection of the foundation).

He teaches seed-protection:

# 402
  
Because the body of all creatures is formed of semen and blood, (188)  
therefore those two must be protected by knowers of mantra.

# 403
  
“Those two” refers to semen and blood. Seed-protection must be performed during menstruation—meaning binding.

Moreover

# 404
  
whatever grahas desire sexual pleasure and behave lustfully in manifold ways (19-189)  
drink semen and blood—when these are destroyed, whence conception?  
Therefore because of this reason, when these are protected conception occurs. (19-190)  
“In these” = in semen and blood. Conception of seed = impregnation. (19-191)

# 405
  
The third:

# 406
  
when the cause of conception has arisen, abortion must be protected against.

# 407
  
“When arisen” = in the embryo, of course.

The fourth:

# 408
  
at the time of delivery of women, by those skilled in the course of protection (191)  
protection must be zealously performed………

# 409
  
“Course of protection” = the previously taught method of envelopment;
by those skilled in it—those of pure intellect—protection must be performed with great effort in the form of mantra-worship, herbs, and prescribed practices.

Thus

# 410
  
………here the violent ones do not harm.

# 411
  
“Here” = at the time of delivery.

He teaches the fifth, protection of the delivered woman:

# 412
  
until the woman in childbed is purified, the child staying in that house (19-192)

# 413
  
so long

# 414
  
defects of the delivery-house etc. torment without protection.  
Therefore it must be well-protected by the wise with outer weapons etc. (19-194)

# 415
  
It must be well-protected—meaning the delivery-house—by the wise with external means such as weapons, etc. (19-193)

The sixth:

# 416
  
at the time of the childbed woman’s bath, whatever child or one staying there  
the mighty bhūtas torment—therefore protect at bathing. (194)

# 417
  
“Or one staying there” = even another child etc. staying in that bathing-house;  
bhūtas torment him too—therefore protect. (19-195)

The seventh:

# 418
  
after that, after bathing, children with nurses must be protected.

After bathing those children who remain must be protected. (195)

# 419
  
Why must the nurse be protected? He declares: the nurse is the cause for him  
through touching milk, nourishment, etc. (19-196)

# 420
  
Therefore she must be protected first, the nurse; thereafter the child.

# 421
  
Moreover

# 422
  
always to be protected through practice of mantra and herbs (196)  
with meditations, mudrās, yantras, unguents,  
with homas of sesame, ghee, etc., with various auspicious pots, (19-197)  
with ablutions upon the head—he must always be protected.

# 423
  
The child who is worthy of protection, of auspicious form,  
must be protected always without slackness—not one of evil birth.

Moreover

# 424
  
awake, asleep, crying, adorned, (19-198)

# 425
  
------------------------------------------------
eating, lying down, standing, playing;

# 426
  
in the morning, at midnight, in the evening, at midday, (19-199)  
at all twilight times the child must be zealously protected.

# 427
  
Playing = moving.

Why zealously at twilights? He declares:

# 428
  
at twilight times is the meeting of gods and demons, of bhūtas, Mothers, sisters, (19-200)  
and evil Piśācas—  
therefore at all twilights the child must be protected. (19-201)

# 429
  
Likewise

# 430
  
going, standing, sleeping, awake—always protected.

# 431
  
He establishes this:

# 432  

O Goddess, the violent ones seek to slay the child the very instant they see him moving about. (19–202)  
Those most terrifying beings stamp their seal upon him if he stands even a moment without protection;  
when he lies peacefully asleep, they terrify him from every side by cunning means. (19–203)  
And the vilest of seizing spirits frighten him in the deep of night even while he is awake.  
Therefore, by every possible endeavour and at all times, the infant must be guarded, O Beloved.  
Without the incantations of the mantras he cannot survive by any other means. (19–204)

# 433  

And moreover:

# 434  

Especially must the royal prince be protected by the initiated priests — (19–205)  
for he is the enjoyer of destiny, supremely auspicious,  
marked by every sign of perfection.

# 435
  
He enjoys fortunes through the door of fruits.

And him because

# 436
  
seeing him the wicked zealously desire to kill the auspicious child; (19-207)

# 437
  

# 438
  
therefore in every way with meditations without interruption,  
or, O Goddess, with moat-weapons, with various auspicious mantras, (19-206)  
with written yantra-unions worshipped with great effort,  
encircled, attached to the neck, with threaded substances, perfumed etc., (19-208)  
with unguents of manifold forms, with worn jewels,  
with protective tilakas, preceded by illumination—  
the prince especially must always be protected. (19-209)

# 439
  
Meditations = filling the Brahmā-aperture etc. with nectar flowing from the upside-down white lotus.  
Of yantra-unions worshipped etc.—the three qualifiers apply to “attached to the neck” like the crow’s Eye.  
Illumination = previously taught.

He teaches the eighth, protection of men:

# 440
  
kings, their ministers, and royal wives, O beloved, (19-210)  
must be protected with certainty by this very rite—  
because vile grahas, Mothers, wicked violent ones, (19-211)  
invincible to gods, mighty, hard to conquer, hard to transgress,  
zealously, constantly, without slackness desire to kill. (19-212)  
For their pacification, out of compassion for creatures,  
mantra-weapons, herb-efforts, and great mighty valour (19-213)  
I have descended all for the grace of mortals.

# 441
  
Weapons = arrows, lances, etc.; “efforts” also includes gems, etc., as indicated by the particle “ca.”

He teaches the speciality of this Lord of Mantras:

# 442
  
of all these mantras of abundant splendour (19-214)  
power, vigour, knowledge, memory, intelligence, body, beauties,  
life—lord of all—the Conqueror of Death proclaimed by Me. (19-215)

# 443
  
“Of these” = of the causes of pacifying grahas etc.—pervasion;  
memory = unwavering cognition; intelligence = the essence of mantras;  
lord = supreme; according to the previously taught method the Conqueror of Death whose nature is the proclaimed form;  
likewise body = particular uttered form; beauties = bestowal of enjoyment and liberation; life = uttered consciousness.

Thus showing its uniqueness among all mantras, He first teaches the state of other mantras:

# 444
  
by abundant sacrifices, japa, homa, austerity, and restraint  
mantras and weapons become accomplished according to the nature of the yuga. (216)  
Likewise in the evil Kali age the most sinful vilest of men—  
for them those mantras bestow accomplishment or do not. (19-217)

# 445
  
In Kṛta and the other yugas whatever disposition is predominant—sattva etc.—  
according to that, in successive yugas with increasingly greater effort, vows, worship, and hardship they become accomplished;  
they bestow or do not bestow—mostly do not, meaning in abundance they do not. (19-218)

But the speciality of the Lord of the Eye is that

# 446
  
for this supreme among gods there is no state limited to Kṛta and the other yugas.

# 447
  
Therefore this

# 448
  
for those whose state accords with disposition, who do not practise austerity and vows, (218)

# 449
  
------------------------------------------------
for all who have resorted to all dispositions, desiring non-duality or duality,

# 450
  
for the unfortunate, lazy, of impure mind afflicted by sin— (19-219)  
because of sole reliance on devotion, it accomplishes here—there is no doubt.

# 451  

Those whose steadfast abiding (niṣṭhā) is perfectly in accord with the emotion of all the darśanas — beginning with the Siddhānta and others —  
even though they do not practise austerity or vows;  
those who have taken refuge in all possible bhavas,  
who remain fully immersed in every kind of worldly activity,  
who are marked by misfortune and the rest,  
and who, out of a desire to triumph over both dualism and non-dualism,  
rest solely upon pure devotion (bhakti-mātra),  
having already settled upon the supreme non-dual permeation that was determined earlier —  

precisely because of that single-pointed worshipfulness (ārādhakatvam),  
here, in this very body, while still alive,  
perfection is accomplished, the radiant immersion (samāveśa) blazes forth,  
and every desired siddhi is brought into being.  
Of this there is no doubt — as was declared before.

And this very (path) …

# 452
  
like the wish-fulfilling gem gives all that is thought of— (19-220)  
likewise accomplishes all works of one who has realised it.

# 453
  
Realised = of firmly resolved mind.

Moreover

# 454
  
as sun and moon in the world illumine in common, (19-221)  
earth, water, fire, air, and space likewise;  
this illumines the common—food destroys hunger like—— (19-222)  
likewise the supreme Lord all-pervading in all beings,  
Śiva devoid of manifestation, giver of all to all, lord;  
the supreme god Conqueror of Death, giver of all siddhis to all. (19-223)

# 455
  
“This” refers to earth, water, fire, air, and space; food, which destroys hunger, performs the common function—
the ordinary sustaining action. The all-giving Lord tears asunder the entire net of bonds—he is the universal liberator.
The rest has already been explained.

Therefore

# 456
  
by sole reliance on devotion, devoted to meditation and meditation, (19-224)  
whoever knows this and has resorted to it, the mantra-knower of unwavering mind—  
he obtains all fruit, becomes worthy of all siddhis. (19-225)

# 457
— thus beginning, the true nature of dhāraṇā has been shown in the eighth chapter.  
The Knower (vettā), the Contemplator (vicāraka), the Knower of virile power (vīryajñaḥ),  
the one whose consciousness is unshaken (niṣkampa-cetanaḥ), whose intellect is firmly established (niścita-dhīḥ),  
for him the entire fruit—which is liberation consisting of the totality of all powers and plenitudes (samasta-saṃpad-ātmikāṃ muktim)—is attained.  
Thus the reading “araha” (He is worthy). Auspiciousness! (iti śivam) || 19-226 ||  

# 458
That which is illumined by the individual soul (Jīva-avabhāsitam)  
that throbs and unfolds (unmeṣi) through complete absorption (samāveśa)  
in the radiant, pulsating pure Consciousness (prasphurat-cit) …  

# 459  
… while bestowing the divine state of embodiment (divyāṃ deha-sthitiṃ kurvan),  
we bow to that Eye (netraṃ) which is the supreme protector and bestower of grace (rakṣā-karam numaḥ).  

Thus, on the Śrī Netra Tantra,
