Thirteenth Chapter
Neṭrodyotaḥ: The Illumination of the Eye

# 2

I take refuge in the Eye that,
flooding everything with surging streams of the supreme nectar of immortality,
makes it entirely consist of That,
and reveals the whole universe to those who possess devotion.

# 3

Having thus linked this chapter to the preceding one,
Śrī Bhagavān speaks in order to cast forth the real subject-matter:

# 4

Thus have I taught the Kaula ritual procedure for this King of Mantras.
Now I shall declare another ritual procedure that bestows fruit. 12

# 5

This (mantra), through the pervasion expressed by “iha” (here/in this),
grants the fullness of both enjoyment and liberation. 13-1

In this connection:

# 6

One should constantly remember Nārāyaṇa
as four-armed, with eyes wide like lotus petals,
resembling a flax flower in colour, one-faced, two-eyed; 1
adorned with conch, discus, mace, lotus and all ornaments;
wearing celestial raiment, the God beautified with divine flowers; 13-2
crowned with a glittering crest-jewel and a net of tinkling bells;
wearing radiant earrings — thus ever risen (in meditation). 13-3

# 7

“Conch, discus, mace and lotus, as well as all ornaments” — this is a compound in the sense.
“One should remember” means: while mentally contemplating this very mantra “iha”. 13-4

# 8  

Or again, contemplate Him seated upon the King of Birds,  
pure and radiant white, of exquisite beauty,  
three-faced, with gentle and gracious countenance,  
adorned with the emblems of Varāha and Hari. (4)  

Possessed of six arms, He displays the boons of favour and fearlessness;  
in His lap meditate upon Śrī,  
bearing weapons and hues that match His own,  
the very embodiment of loveliness and splendour,  
facing the God of gods. (13–5)

# 9

“Vara and abhaya” are mentioned in addition to the previously described conch etc.
“Loveliness and radiance” refer to the beauty of the arrangement of limbs.

With the method of His retinue:

# 10

In the four directions one should worship the Goddesses;
in the intermediate directions, the limbs (aṅgas). 13-6

# 11

The nyāsa of the limbs is as taught earlier. 13-7

He describes the Goddesses:

# 12

Jaya, Lakṣmī, Kīrti and Māyā — these one should worship in the (four) directions.

# 13–14

And these (Goddesses) are

# 14

bearing noose and goad,  
their hands bestowing boons and granting fearlessness. 7

# 15

Facing the God, one should meditate upon them
as possessing forms and colour identical with Śrī.

# 16

Their limbs resemble the God’s;
they bear weapons of His colour. 13-8
Because of their similarity to the God and because the limbs are inner (more intimate),
worship is performed first (for them).

# 17

Having thus spoken according to the teaching of the Śrījayā-Saṃhitā,
He also declares the same following the Māyāvāmanikā tradition:

# 18

Alternatively, meditate upon the God as eight-armed,
of golden yellow hue, supremely beautiful,
seated upon a ram, O Goddess, naked in all directions,
with erect liṅga. 13-9

# 19

Concerning this form, He now describes the placement of the additional pair of hands
beyond the previously mentioned six arms and their weapons:

# 20

With one hand grasping the horn (of the ram)…

# 21

“of the ram” — belonging to the ram; “seated” is understood.

Likewise:

# 22

...with another hand raised as though to strike.  
One should ever worship the child form,  
eternally playing amidst groups of women. 13-10

# 23

And for this (form):

# 24

In the four directions stand Goddesses,
naked, enchanting:
Karpūrī, Candanī, Kastūrī and Kuṅkumī. 13-11

# 25  
These (very Yoginīs) furthermore  

# 26  
are the divine bearers of His own form (tadrūpa-dhārikā devyaḥ),  
bestowing the fruit of the attainment of (all) desires (icchā-siddhi).

# 27

Or again:

# 28

Why say more here at length?
One should remember Him as possessing universal form,
with multitudes of faces and multitudes of arms bearing weapons. 12

# 29

Or again:

# 30

Lying upon His couch, or at His wedding,
together with half of Lakṣmī;
or as solitary Narasiṃha, or Vārāha, or Vāmana;
or as Kapila worthy of worship;
or as the Unmanifest, or the Partless. 13-13–14

# 31

“Unmanifest” is the name given here;
and He who is partless has a supremely tranquil nature. 13-15

Moreover:

# 32

In whatever manner, by whatever distinction of feeling one remembers Him,
one becomes filled with That very nature —
such is the supreme command of the Goddess. 15

# 33

(Mṛtyujit, the Conqueror of Death) is implied. 13-16

Now, following the form of the solar deities etc. taught in the Saura-saṃhitās, the Vedas and other texts,
He teaches the worship of Mṛtyujit:

# 34

Therefore I shall now declare Him as consisting purely of radiant light,
by which men attain siddhi:
resembling a red lotus, possessing the lustre of lac-juice, 16
the colour of a heap of vermilion, equal in radiance to ruby,
like safflower dye, possessing the splendour of pomegranate flowers; 13-17
resembling the fire at the end of a kalpa, one-faced, three-eyed,
four-armed, the Great Self, his hands granting boons and fearlessness. 13-18

# 35

Thus one should meditate upon Sūrya. 13-19

And He:

# 36

holds a thunderbolt in one hand and rays in another.

# 37  
And that (form in which the seizure occurs) He now describes:

# 38  
Mounted upon a chariot drawn by seven horses, wearing a serpent as the sacred thread,  
adorned with red garlands and red garments, anointed with red fragrances;  
or else, O Goddess, eight-armed, equipped with the weapons of the Lokapālas,  
three-faced, with a fierce countenance, three-eyed, with a terrifying face—  
always worship Him seated upon a horse in the center of a lotus. 13-21

# 39

The weapons of the Lokapālas are:
thunderbolt, Śakti, staff, sword, noose, banner, mace and trident. 22

He now describes the retinues of the Blessed One:

# 40

One should worship heart, head, tuft, armour, eyes and weapon.

# 41

That is: all limbs should be placed as taught earlier.

And here:

# 42

In the centre of the lotus one should worship the God;
on the second (circle) the eight planets. 13-22

# 43

The planets are the six beginning with the Moon, plus Ketu and Rāhu.
“On the second” means on the (second) circle of the retinue. 13-23

# 44

On the third, the lunar mansions, grouped three by three according to sequence;
on the tips of the petals, groups of three are to be worshipped;
on the fourth, the Lokapālas; 23
on the fifth circle of the lotus one should worship the eight weapons.

# 45

The lunar mansions, divided into groups of three,
are placed on the eight petals beginning with the east — twenty-four —
and three more on the tip of the eastern petal:
thus the third circle is that of the lunar mansions;
the fourth is that of the Lokapālas; the fifth is that of the weapons.

He also teaches another method:

# 46

Or as standing alone, two-armed, accompanied by rays; 13-24
or as possessing the form of Viśvakarman,
or as the Lord of the universe having universal form,
four-armed Great Self, holding chisel and book, 13-25
a pair of tongs in the left hand
and a cord in the right;
contemplate Him praised by gods, siddhas and gandharvas. 13-26

# 47

“sandamśam” means “bearing tongs”. 13-27

All that has been taught and will be taught

# 48

may be worshipped on solid ground, in fire, in water,
on a mountain peak,
or wherever the mind finds delight —
it grants the fruit of accomplishment of desires. 27

# 49

For this Blessed One, unlike other deities,
there is no restriction whatsoever even regarding the support.
“In the mind” — the locative is used in the sense of the dative.

Moreover:

# 50

White as conch, jasmine and moon, three-eyed,
in the form of Rudra,
mounted on a bull, meditate upon Him as Sadāśiva. 13-28

# 51  
four-armed, the Great-Souled One, endowed with trident and the gesture of fearlessness,  

# 52  
The Lord who holds a citron fruit and a rosary of beads. 13-29

# 53

“Four-armed, mounted on a bull” — this is the distinguishing feature from the form of Sadāśiva. 13-30

In the same way:

# 54

Or contemplate the God as many-armed,
standing in a dancing posture,
bearing half the body of Umā,
or bearing half the body of Viṣṇu; 30
or meditate upon Him seated at His wedding
and worship Him as standing close by.

# 55

“Standing close by” means close to Goddess Umā (is implied).

Moreover:

# 56  
Brahmā is four-faced, gentle, red in colour, of beautiful eyes,  
with hanging tuft of hair, extremely brilliant, mounted on a swan, four-armed,  
holding a staff and rosary in his hands, bearing a water-pot and the gesture of fearlessness,  
accompanied by the four Vedas: He who grants the fruit of all siddhis. (13-31–32)

# 57  
“Accompanied by the Vedas” means the Vedas with form stand at his sides.

Furthermore:

# 58  
Buddha, seated in padmāsana, with long earlobes and saffron robe,  
lotus-eyed, bearing the lotus mark, adorned with gems, benefactor of the world,  
absorbed in samādhi, the great yogi, his hands in boon-bestowing and fear-dispelling gestures,  
the deity holding a rosary, with lotus in hand, of beautiful eyes—  
thus meditated upon and worshipped, He grants the fruit of liberation even to women. 13-35

# 59  
“He whose eyes are like lotuses”; “he who bears the lotus-mark” means the lotus insignia stamped on his hands or elsewhere.  
“Mani-baddha” (bound by jewels): the suffix is used in the sense of the āhitāgni class, etc., hence in the intensive sense.  

Or alternatively:

# 60

Why speak at length here, O Fair One?
Kārtikeya, Kāma, Sūrya, Soma, Vināyaka, 13-36
all the Lokapālas,
and whatever other deities are born of divine wombs;
in the Gāruḍa, Bhūta-tantras and in the Vāg-vidhānas everywhere; 13-37
in the Nyāya, Ārhata and Yoga systems;
in the countless Vedic and other traditions;
in the Yāmala, in the Ekavīra, in the Navaka,
in the Trika divisions; 13-38
in the Samabheda, in the Devyākhyā,
in the Durga texts, in Vindhyavāsinī;
in the Caṇḍikā etc. group of four,
in the self-arisen Great Lord (liṅga); 13-39
in the previously established form
or in the form assigned by ṛṣis and men;
in various weapons,
in all the Vidyā-pīṭhas; 13-40
in all the Pātāla-tantras, among the Nāgas,
in the Drāviḍa texts —
the infinite Śaktis, O one of good vows, 13-41
worshipped with this mantra
according to the respective ritual procedures,
all bestow the fruit of every siddhi.
They all become unfailing;
my word is true, not false. 13-42

# 61

“Sūrya” was previously described according to the Saṃhitās;
here, however, he is the external one.
“The others” include those up to Dhruva.
All deities beginning with Kārtikeya,
and the Śaktis and deities taught in the Gāruḍa etc. up to the Drāviḍa texts —
all of them, when worshipped with this very mantra
according to the ritual procedures famous in each respective scripture,
grant the fruit of every siddhi — this is the connection.
(In Nyāya) the Lord Maheśvara who is omniscient etc. and distinct from men;
(in Ārhata) the Arhat;
(in Yoga) the special Puruṣa untouched by afflictions etc.;
the Vedic etc. beginning with Agni in the Vedic, Paurāṇika and Itihāsa traditions;
“Yāmala” refers to Brahmayāmala, Rudrayāmala etc.;
“Ekavīra” to Parātrīśikā, Matatriṃśikā etc.;
“Navaka” to the Navātma-cakra etc.;
“Trika” to the sixfold path;
“Samabheda” to the teachings called sama and viṣama;
“Devyākhyā” to the divisions such as Mahāghorā, Jayā etc.;
“Vindhyavāsinī” to the text treating that named deity;
“group of four beginning with Caṇḍikā” to the texts of the southern and northern currents teaching worship of each set of four deities;
“self-arisen Great Lord” refers to the liṅga-form of Maheśvara that has arisen of itself;
“previously established” and “assigned by ṛṣis and men” are in apposition (both in locative).
“Various” refers to sword, arrow etc.;
“among the Nāgas” means in the forms of each serpent;
“Drāviḍa” means those famous in the Drāviḍa etc. regions.
“Unfailing” etc. as before. 13-43

Moreover, this (Mṛtyujit)

# 62

is the God common to all, granting the fruit of all siddhis,
for He is remembered as the very life of all mantras. 43

# 63  
Thereafter (He declares):

# 64  
In the rites of installation and worship, in the auspicious pedestal, in the arghya vessel,  
in the purification of fire, and in nyāsa, meditation, and the vehicle (āsana)— (13-44)

# 65  
no distinction or option is ever to be made, because this God is common to all (sarva-sādhāraṇaḥ).  
“Vehicle” here means seat (āsana).  
“Distinction” means one should not entertain any doubt here on the basis of the differences in pervasion taught in the dualistic or non-dualistic scriptures,  
for this God, through the supreme non-dual pervasion already described, is common to all—  
He is like the uniform ground on which the variegated picture of the universe is painted. This is the meaning.

And therefore:

# 66

Therefore let no confusion arise here;
abandon all doubt. 13-45

# 67

The meaning: here, unlike elsewhere,
there is no confusion whatsoever of mantras etc.

This too is a glory of this King of Mantras:

# 68–69

Chanted only once and abiding in the body;
only once in the arghya vessel;
placed only once in the hands;
in mental worship, by a single chanting;
situated externally, worshipped only once;
only once in sun and moon;
only once in fire-offering, only once to be chanted;
in water, worshipped only once —
only once, only once, everywhere
one should worship the Supreme Lord.

# 69

Because He shines forth by a single (utterance), this has been stated thus.

Therefore:

# 70

The toil of prāṇāyāma etc., mudrās, yoga and concentration 13-48
are not at all employed for this King of Mantras, O one of good vows.

# 71  
All worship and related rites of this Bhagavān  

# 72  
must be performed with resolute determination (vyavasāyena); otherwise never…  

# 73  
by entering into the virility of the great mantra through the easy method of complete settledness (sukhena upāyena), not through painful exertion—this is the meaning.  
If, however, one resorts to laborious prāṇāyāma and the like, then that very thing becomes here  

# 74  
…a defect. (13-49)  

# 75  
But when performed with resolute determination,  
it becomes flawless for the best of sādhakas and for the king, causing the prosperity of the kingdom.  
Thus auspiciousness.  

# 76  
I bow to the Śārva Netra—the Eye that is the very Self of consciousness,  
which shines forth once and for all, bursting open every restraint,  
in which there exists no difference between the systems of the same tantra and other tantras,  
nor any division among the seats upon which it is placed.  

# 77  
Śārvam.

Thus, on the Śrī Netra Tantra,  
in the *Netrodyota* composed by the venerable Kṣemarāja,  
who is supreme among the great Ācāryas devoted to Maheśvara,  
this concludes the thirteenth chapter:
**Openness of the Worship to All Human Beings**
