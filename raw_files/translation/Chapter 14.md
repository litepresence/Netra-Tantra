Fourteenth Chapter
Neṭrodyotaḥ: The Illumination of the Eye

# 2

By unfolding His own splendor (nija-ojasa) through His own splendor alone,
He causes His own wheel of mantras to throb within His own Self.
For the sake of grace, He manifests the Eye—
I bow to that Lord whose dual vision brings peace to that (dual vision).

# 3

Thus, when the entire cluster of authorities (adhikāra-kadambaka) had established, in answer to the question, that the King of Mantras possesses the form of the supreme non-dual reality—the great secret that transcends and unifies all darśanas—and thereby suggested the non-usefulness of all lower mantras, the revered Devī spoke:

“If, O Lord, the mantra that has been described as supreme (para) is indeed the highest,

# 4

then of all tantras whatsoever and of all deities in every respect,
this Heart—He, the Emperor of Mantras—is the supreme (para).
He bestows all siddhis.
What then is the use of other chief mantras that are repeated according to desire? Tell me this, O my Lord.” (14.1)

# 5

Here, at the beginning, the word "tarhi" ("then why?") must be supplied implicitly.
The particle "ca" ("and") also collectively includes the question: "What is the use even of the various wonderful methods of worshipping Him?"
The word "sve" ("my") is separate (i.e., it forms the vocative "O my Lord").

Thus questioned, the holy Lord said:

# 6

“Well asked, well asked, O Mahā-īśānī!
O sinless one, you have asked me exactly that—
I shall now declare the essence that is supreme and everlasting.” (2)

# 7

“That very thing about which you have asked me I shall now fully explain, for it is the everlasting, certain, supreme secret.” (14.3)

He begins to speak of it:

# 8

“This (universe) existed as the form of Śakti—
incomparable, free from affliction,
Śiva, all-pervading, pure,
unthinkable, beyond the senses.” (3)

# 9

“This” (idam)—whatever appears as limited by the measurer that is body etc.—
from the standpoint of the measurer that is the supreme consciousness (para-cit-pramātṛ), which is not encompassed by body etc.,
was nothing but the form of Śakti, distinct from the supreme measurer.

Therefore:

# 10

"Just as all things (bhāvāḥ), infinite in number, shine fully in one’s own Self through one’s own Self,
so do they shine in this (supreme Self).” (Īśvara-Pratyabhijñā-vimarśinī 2.1.7)

# 11

—thus it possessed the nature of being incomparable in its repose, etc. The rest has already been explained earlier. (14.4)

Hence:

# 12

“Desiring to create, O Devī, through His own will,
endowed with the power of knowledge and the nature of action—
this first Lord of gods, all-knowing, all-pervading, Śiva,
the God who is the Self of everything and everything,
the instigator of the primal creation.” (4)

# 13

That universe which existed as the form of Śakti—because Śakti and the possessor of Śakti are one—
He is this first, the primordial principle (pradhāna).
He whose nature is everything and everything (sarva-sarva),
whose Self is of such a nature—
through His own will, through the power of knowledge alone,
having assumed the station of the power of action,
without depending on the reflections of Sadāśiva etc.,
He is the instigator, the manifester, of the primal creation
that contains within its womb the boundless intermediary play of creation and dissolution.

Having thus manifested the primal creation, on that very plane:

# 14

“Thereafter, indeed, the creation of mantras
was accomplished by Śiva, the supreme Self.” (14.5)

# 15

“Manifold, composed in various ways,
arranged according to distinct divisions.”

# 16

“Just in that very way, the Lord of gods,
the Supreme who is the Self of everything and everything,” (14.6)

# 17  

“tataḥ” means upon That very Ground (tad-bhittā) alone.  
“aṇu” means in perfect correspondence with the sovereign Light of Self-awareness that predominates as one’s own essential nature.  
“bheda-vyavasthayā” means through the wondrous play of manifold forms in which the grace-receiving beings are made manifest by the act of grace.  

Thus, exactly in the same way that Śiva has fashioned the creation of the countless mantras,  
so too, with the intent that the all-pervasive, supreme non-dual nature of those mantras should never be diminished or lost,  
He who is the All-in-all, the Supreme Lord who sustains and fulfils every mantra in the universe,  
He who is the universal Great Universal (mahā-sāmānya),  
and who therefore, like the word “being” (sat) that denotes all things whatsoever (pots, etc.),  
is the touchstone of His own undivided majesty,  
He who has been fashioned by none but Śiva Himself, the Supreme Self,  
and who has been unfolded by the unfolding of His own supreme Śakti —  

when it is thus understood, then indeed He is the very Self of all beings.  
“hi” means precisely because this is so.  

Therefore, this stainless One is never tainted, never stained, never encompassed by differentiation  
by the mantras of the Veda, the Vaiṣṇava, the Gāruḍa, the Siddhānta, and all other traditions;  
for those mantras which are imagined to stain Him  
possess no real substantiality apart from the heroic energy of the great mantras  
whose essence is nothing but the radiance of that very Consciousness.

And furthermore:

# 18

“Countless millions of mantras, manifest and unmanifest,
are established—
all of them bestow siddhis when enclosed by Him who has beginning and end.” (14.8)
“When recited together with this enclosing frame, they yield the fruit of siddhi.
For that purpose, O fair-hipped one, it has been revealed to you out of affection—
the supreme secret, the truth…”

# 19

“Countless” refers relative to their retinues.
“Manifest and unmanifest” means sakala (with form) and niṣkala (formless).
“Beginning and end” refers to enclosing creation as stated in the scriptural tradition: “Having enclosed creation…” (Parā-trīśikā 3).
That very abode of consciousness—which is the virile power of the great mantra and the primordial source—unfolds the wheel of mantras upon its own ground and illuminates it solely through the light of consciousness.
Thus, here the term “nirodha” (enclosing/restraining) is intended primarily in the sense of virile power; the enclosure effected through mantra recitation is secondary.

And since this is the supreme secret of such a kind:

# 20

“…must never be revealed to just anyone.”

# 21

—specifically, not to one whose latent impression of duality has not ceased.

For:

# 22

“If kept secret, O Devī, it bestows perfect siddhi;
if revealed, it destroys siddhi.” (14.10)

# 23

“Supreme siddhi” (śobhanā siddhiḥ) is that which culminates in both enjoyment (bhukti) and liberation (mukti).

# 24

“Therefore the oral tradition must be kept extremely secret.”

# 25

The tradition (saṃpradāya) that issues from the mouth—the very face of the supreme Śakti—
whose nature is the secret that has been explained,
is given only to one who, having intensely considered the most intense descent of Śakti, is fit to receive it.
Thus this tradition must be kept perfectly secret, reposing in oneself. Thus ends auspiciously.

Whose splendour is the beautiful throbbing of the King of Mantras,
radiant with the virile energy that flashes as beginning and end—

# 26

Having placed within His own abode
the hundred families of Śambara equal in virile energy, throbbing—

# 27

Everywhere accomplishing the playful acts of various kinds of grace,
auspicious—

# 28

I praise the Eye,
overflowing with the nectar of supreme bliss that is the totality of Śaktis.

# 29

Thus, on the Śrī Netra Tantra,  
in the *Netrodyota* composed by the venerable Kṣemarāja,  
who is supreme among the great Ācāryas devoted to Maheśvara,  
this concludes the fourteenth chapter:
**Supremacy of the Mantra Over Other Mantras**
