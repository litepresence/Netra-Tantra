Eleventh Chapter
Neṭrodyotaḥ: The Illumination of the Eye

# 2

I bow to the Eye of the Trident-holder—
the Left Vision that pours forth the enjoyment of all good fortune,
revealing the Supreme Bliss.


# 3

Having previously shown, in the practice of the Right Current, the essential identity with the Lord who conquers Death, now, for the sake of realising the essential identity with the Leftward Gaze,

The Blessed Lord spoke:

# 4

Now I shall declare the supreme Uttaratantra.
By this mantra one must worship; it yields the fruit of all siddhis. (10)

# 5

Its supremacy arises solely from the reasoning that this mantra is pervaded by the essence of the non-dual Para. (11-1)

In this regard:

# 6

For the pacification of all calamities, upon an eight-petalled lotus in a bed of kuśa grass,
O Goddess, in the previously described maṇḍala, place in the centre the god Tumburu. (1)
Ten-armed, lord of the gods, five-faced, three-eyed,

# 7

seated upon the throne installed by the root mantra, and installed there by the root mantra itself,

# 8

one should assign his faces with the form of Sadāśiva. (11-2)

# 9

By the root mantra alone. (11-3)

# 10

Meditate upon him wearing a crest-moon on his head, seated upon the lotus throne,
white as frost, kuṇḍa flower, and the moon, resembling a mountain of ice;
wearing a sacred thread of serpents, adorned with serpent ornaments,
wearing all jewels, with a tiger-skin about his loins; (11-4)
clad in elephant-hide, mounted on a bull, of great strength;
bearing sword and shield, adorned with hatchet and skull; (11-5)
bearing noose and goad, holding discus and rosary;
with hands granting boons and dispelling fear, destroyer of all sins. (11-6)

# 11

One should meditate thus. The lotus throne is pervaded by pure knowledge (śuddhavidyā); above it the bull is pervaded by the power of the sacred sound (nādaśakti); above that is the God who is pure consciousness. “Taṅka” is a particular weapon (a battle-axe); “kanda” means skull. (11-7)

Regarding him:

# 12

In all directions stand the goddesses; beginning from the east, the Dūtīs,
and in the south-east and the other intermediate quarters, likewise the Kiṅkaras at the doors. (7)

# 13

He names the Dūtīs and Kiṅkaras:

# 14

Jambhanī, Mohanī, Subhagā, and Durbhagā—
these are declared the Dūtīs. Now hear the supreme Kiṅkaras: (11-8)
Krodhanā, Vṛntaka, Gajakarṇa, and Mahābala.

# 15

Of Lord Tumburu,

# 16

to the right and left one should install Gāyatrī and Sāvitrī. (11-9)
Below and above, then place the Goad (aṅkuśa) and Māyā.
“Thereafter” means the Kiṅkaras are outside the entire mantra-circle.

# 17

Thus, in due order,

# 18

all these are always to be joined with the root mantra. (11-10)

# 19

He describes their meditation:

# 20

The goddesses are white, red, yellow, and black, each with four faces.

# 21

Among them, in the centre:

# 22

four-armed, three-eyed, bearing hatchet and skull, (11-11)
holding staff and rosary, shining resplendent upon a corpse-throne.
The goddess Jayā, then Vijayā, red in colour, four-armed, (11-12)
four-faced, three-eyed, bearing arrow and bow,
the goddess holding sword and shield, seated upon an owl. (11-13)
Ajitā, Padmagarbhā, four-faced, four-armed,
the goddess bearing Śakti and bell, holding hide and shield, (11-14)
mounted upon a horse, the great goddess adorned with all ornaments.

# 23

Ajitā is Jayantī.

# 24

Resembling a broken sapphire, four-faced, richly adorned, (11-15)
four-armed, three-eyed, bearing noose and goad,
holding jewelled vessel and mace, perfectly seated upon a divine throne, (11-16)
clad in golden raiment, adorned with golden ornaments.

# 25

This means Aparājitā.

And these:

# 26

stationed in their own directions, desired and meditated upon, grant the fruits of siddhi. (11-17)

# 27

But in the intermediate quarters:

# 28

the Dūtīs bearing the same forms, yet adorned with a single face,
two-armed, three-eyed, ornamented with severed heads and cleaver. (11-18)

# 29

In due order:

# 30

fish, tortoise, makara, and frog—these are their seats.

# 31

Moreover:

# 32

the Kiṅkaras bear swords, are two-armed, hold shields, (11-19)
single-faced, three-eyed, with frowning and fierce eyes.
Meditated upon as white and the other colours, they grant the fruits of siddhi. (11-20)

# 33

“White and the others”—by the word “ādi” are meant red, yellow, and black.

# 34

Gāyatrī is red in colour, adorned with a single face,
seated in padmāsana, eyes opened in meditation. (11-21)

# 35

Sāvitrī is white in colour, eyes closed in meditation.

# 36

Her limbs are likewise [as Gāyatrī]…

# 37

“Her limbs likewise” means the goddess has one face and four arms, yet
holds noose, goad, book, and rosary. “The goddess” refers to both Gāyatrī and Sāvitrī.

Moreover:

# 38

Māyā is black, four-armed. (11-22) 
With a great cloth she conceals, with the pair of hands forming the cupped gesture.

# 39

“With the great…” means with an all-pervading cloth of expanded knowledge she inevitably conceals the universe at her sides as though with noose and goad; likewise, with the pair of hands slightly cupped, she is characterised as concealing the universe within. (11-23)

Moreover:

# 40

The Goad has the form of Bhairava: the all-pervading Lord bearing noose and goad, (23)
bearing skull and khaṭvāṅga, greedy for fat, blood, and flesh.

# 41

“With the form of Bhairava” means with frowning face, protruding fangs. Hence in the revered Nandīśikhā it is said:

# 42

“Single-faced, greatly terrifying.”

# 43

Thus it is stated. And likewise:

# 44

“…lustrous like moist coral.

# 45

Having heads shaped like noose and goad, he is supreme in drawing the object of worship.”

From this very statement in that text, he should be contemplated in this form. (11-24)

For the purpose of installing the seat of the mantra-circle (to be described), he declares the boat:

# 46

The milk-ocean, the earth, the auspicious foundational Śakti— (24)
employ these as the seat; for pacification, a white lotus.

# 47

The foundational Śakti is pervaded by space; above it the earth; above that, pervaded by the elements, the milk-ocean; above that, having the dharma of floating and moving, pervaded by the pair fire and wind—the boat. And the bulb of the white lotus is pervaded by pure knowledge. As stated in the revered former (tantra):

# 48

“At the beginning, the foundational Śakti four fingers below the navel,
earth, milk-ocean, boat, and bulb—thus the group of four.” (Mālinīvijayottara 8.55)

# 49

Thus. (11-25)

Having described the meditation of the seat and mantra-circle, he now states a special point here: all

# 50

O Mistress of the Gods, pure white (or very bright) ones bring about pacification. (25)
Red, yellow, and black should be meditated upon according to the difference of rites.

# 51

For the varieties of attraction, etc. (11-26)

As in the previous chapters, he now teaches the method of protection:

# 52

Now I shall declare another great and powerful Cakrarāja. (26)

# 53

“Great and powerful” means irresistible in pacification and the rest. (11-27)

In this regard:

# 54

With the mantra placed at beginning and end as a casket, write the name in the middle.
Install the god, the goddesses, and the Dūtīs by the former method. (27)
In the middle, on the petals, on the filaments, elsewhere, in all places, O wise one.

# 55

Summary meaning: Having written the name of the target enclosed in the mantra upon the lunar disc in the pericarp of a lotus drawn with cow’s bile-etc. substances as previously described, meditate above it upon the god together with Sāvitrī and Gāyatrī and worship with white offerings. On the petals beginning from the east, the four goddesses Jayā etc.; on the filaments in the intermediate quarters beginning from the south-east, the Dūtīs Jambhanī etc.—having written their names enclosed in the mantra; outside the lotus, in the four directions, the Kiṅkaras; outside them, Māyā and Aṅkuśa; outside them, draw a four-cornered figure marked with the vajra; then worship the entire mantra-circle with white offerings. The word “and the Dūtīs” includes the Kiṅkaras and the pair Māyā-Aṅkuśa. “Elsewhere” means the installation of Kiṅkaras etc. outside the lotus area. By “in all places” is indicated the city with four corners outside Māyā and Aṅkuśa.

This is the protective circle:

# 56

With appropriate abundant offerings, for great pacification of oneself (11-28)
or of another, it should be employed…

# 57

Having drawn and worshipped it, it should be bound.

Moreover:

# 58

…it is to be worshipped in Śānti rites.

# 59

Having made an outer maṇḍala…

Here, appropriately, he teaches the fire-offering:

# 60

With sesame, rice, honey, ghee, milk, and sugar (11-29)
one should offer oblations as before in a circular pit kindled with excellent fuel.

# 61

For the satisfaction of the mantra-circle—this is the implied meaning. “As before” means circular. (11-30)

When this is done, for the one to be protected:

# 62

great peace arises. My word is true, not false. (30)

# 63

And these:

# 64

in all protective rites, the goddesses are to be worshipped; they grant perfect siddhi.

# 65

By the order of the lotus previously described. (11-31)

In external worship, also by another order—he declares:

# 66

Or one may worship the goddesses in rows, and the god Tumburu in the middle. (31)

# 67

The sādhaka of controlled senses obtains all prosperities.

Only with one-pointed mind.

# 68

Or employing it for another, he conquers here—without doubt. (11-32)

# 69

“Here” means in this world. He conquers, i.e., exists with complete supremacy in all desired things. Thus auspiciousness. (11-33)

# 70

All siddhis and the Leftward Current circle-worship
yield forth; the glorious Mṛtyujit conquers
the Eye that is the mighty nectar of the Śākta teaching.

# 71

Thus, on the Śrī Netra Tantra,  
in the *Netrodyota* composed by the venerable Kṣemarāja,  
who is supreme among the great Ācāryas devoted to Maheśvara,  
this concludes the eleventh chapter:
