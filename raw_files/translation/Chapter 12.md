Twelfth Chapter
Neṭrodyotaḥ: The Illumination of the Eye

That Eye which, though it brings about the end even of Kāma (the god of desire), yet solely fulfils the desires of countless beings;

# 2

which is the destroyer of the universe, the immaculate destroyer of the Destroyer (Antaka), which is beyond Kula yet is the noblest Kula;

# 3

which, being the supreme protectress of the three worlds, radiates with complete bliss through the utter annihilation of all differentiation;

# 4

that Eye of Śarva, that Eye which has itself as its own abode, that Eye whose essence is the three supreme abodes — to That we offer praise.

# 5

In order to reveal the supreme Kula tradition (kulāmnāya) which is the very essence of the non-dual Mṛtyujit (Victor over Death) Nātha, after having first unfolded the form of the triple current — upward, right, and left — the blessed Lord spoke:

“Now, therefore, I shall clearly expound the illustrative teaching of the Kula tradition (kulāmnāya-nidarśana) — the ritual of sacrifice (Yāga), oblation (homa), and repetition (japa) — by performing which one obtains everything.” (11)

The meaning of “illustrative teaching of the Kula tradition” (kulāmnāya-nidarśana) is: the action that must be performed which clearly manifests the light of the Kula tradition. I shall now fully expound the correct performance of sacrifice, oblation, and so forth, by which the sādhaka attains all enjoyment as well as liberation.

First, from the Īśāna corner to the Vāyavya direction one should worship Gaṇeśa, Vaṭuka, the Guru, and the rest; in the east, south, and west, Śrī Kheceśvara, Kūrma, Meṣanātha, together with their retinues of Dūtīs; in the north, the six princely masters of authority beginning with Śrīmacchanda, Kuṅkuṇāmba, and so on, together with their Dūtīs — thus, with the mantra ending at the feet, one should worship them. This is the meaning of the words “illustrative teaching of the Kula tradition.” (1)

Now, within the series of Gurus of the (present) Pair of Ages (yuga),

# 6

In the centre of the lotus one must worship Bhairava exactly as previously described.

The eight Goddesses naturally abide on the petals beginning with the eastern one. (1)

And (they possess) the very forms, weapons, and vehicles of the gods beginning with Brahmā.

# 7

“Of the gods beginning with Brahmā, in their own nature” — that is, in the very form by which those gods (Brahmā and the rest) perform creation and the other cosmic functions. Their own forms, weapons, and vehicles are those belonging to Brahmā and the others.

He now indicates their names:

# 8

Brāhmī, Māheśvarī, Kaumārī, Vaiṣṇavī,
Vārāhī, Māhendrī, Cāmuṇḍā, and Bahurūpiṇī. (12–2)

# 9

The first four are placed in the eastern, southern, and successive quarters; the latter ones in the intermediate directions beginning with Īśāna and Vāyu. In this way, by both the forward (anuloma) and reverse (pratiloma) orders, creation and dissolution are encompassed — thus say the teachers.

He now clearly describes the differences in their forms, weapons, and seats:

# 10

From Brahmā up to Bahurūpiṇī is their form; their own vehicle,
their own weapon, and all of them are adorned in their own proper form. (12–3)

# 11

The form of Brahmā and the others — reddish complexion, four arms, and so forth — is precisely their form. Their vehicle is the very same vehicle, namely: swan, bull, peacock, Gāruḍa, Airāvaṇa, crocodile, and corpse. For Vārāhī, however, no vehicle is visible. Their weapon is the very same weapon: staff, trident, spear, discus, thunderbolt, and sword — these in the right hands. All these seats and the rest shine forth in their own inherent nature.

For the remaining three hands he prescribes the common rule:

# 12

Holding a skull and a skull-topped staff, with their right hands raised in gestures of boon-bestowing and fearlessness...

# 13

The left hand is in the boon-bestowing gesture. (12–5)

Having stated nyāsa according to the order of directions, he also states it according to the order of rows (paṅkti):

# 14

Or one may worship the Goddesses standing in rows — they grant all desired fruits.

# 15

“Of the God, both on the right and left sides, four and four” — that is the meaning.

Moreover, these (Goddesses):

# 16

For the sake of peace for all beings, by one who desires their welfare, (5)
they must be worshipped with abundant sacrifice according to one’s desire.

# 17

For peace and the like, in white form and so forth — that is the meaning.

# 18

Especially, O Devi, they must be worshipped by royal preceptors even for the sake of kings. (12–6)

# 19

With great material offerings — that is the meaning. (12–7)

Because:

# 20

By the grace of these very Goddesses alone do all kings
enjoy a kingdom free of thorns; they are fortunate upon the earth. (7)

# 21

And this is fitting — thus he declares:

# 22

Because this entire universe is born from the very nature of the Goddesses.
These, O beloved, are the wombs and essential forms of the universe beginning with the gods. (12–8)
All of them remove the multitude of sufferings of beings, O beloved;
like mothers they perpetually protect and sustain the world. (12–9)

# 23

Because they are the cause of the universe, they protect the creation of beings spontaneously, just as the universe itself does — how much more when worshipped! — that is the meaning. (12–10)

Furthermore:

# 24

Just as farmers, O beloved, keep the world in the form of seed-power
in a granary at the time of dissolution, so do these (Goddesses) preserve it,
and again create it here. (10)

# 25

Just as farmers at the time of dissolution — in the month of Pauṣa, at the time of universal withdrawal — preserve the world, which has become mere seed-potency and remains in the immobile state, in a granary or storage pit, and afterwards cause it to sprout again, so do the Goddesses, at the times of the dissolution of the world-soul, preserve the residual impressions and again make (the universe) ready for creation. (12–11)

# 26

And just as farmers in due season sow seed
for the sake of fruit, so do these (Goddesses) bestow fruit
through Brahmā’s desire to create at the beginning of a kalpa. (11)

# 27

“In due season” means in spring. “Bestowing fruit” refers to the Goddesses. The “kalpa of Brahmā” is Brahmā’s own day; the desire to create therein is the instrumental cause. The word “Brahma-kalpa” also denotes (the days) up to Sadāśiva. For it is the Goddesses alone who, presiding over the respective causal levels from Sadāśiva down to Brahmā, perform creation and the other functions. As it is said in the venerable Svacchanda Tantra:
“Brāhmī is the power of the Lord; wherever there is will, there she causes it to fall,”

and similarly:

# 28

“Viṣṇu is known as belonging to Vaiṣṇavī…” etc. (12–12)

# 29

And since:

# 30

At the beginning of the kalpa, in the middle, and at the end, they pervade the entire universe;
therefore, for every purpose, for the sake of peace, as benefactresses, (12)
they must be worshipped, O Devi, offered oblations, and meditated upon by one who desires siddhi.

# 31

“Offered oblations” means satisfied by homa. “By one who desires siddhi” means by the seeker of perfection.

Furthermore:

# 32

With all kinds of seeds smeared with the three sweets, or with sesame, or with auspicious Śrī-phala, (12–13)
or with flowers of the highest excellence, or with other fruits properly offered in fire —
the Goddesses grant all perfections and fulfil all desires. (12–14)

# 33

Because it is their very nature to grant all perfections, they bestow the fruits of all desires — that is the meaning.

In this connection:

# 34

Homa that grants all desires of Śarva is recommended with sesame mixed with ghee;
for the accomplishment of wealth, with grains; from homa with ghee and guggulu
arises abundant siddhi — inferior, middling, and supreme.
With white lotuses, red lotuses, and bilva fruits one obtains prosperity.

(2.280–281)

# 35

And so forth — one should follow what is stated in the venerable Svacchanda Tantra. Thus auspiciousness. (12–15)

# 36

By their own natures that accomplish the creation of the universe and the rest,
according to the sequence of the families beginning with Brahmā and the others —
the glorious sole Akula Netra-Bhairava triumphs!

# 37

Thus, on the Śrī Netra Tantra,  
in the *Netrodyota* composed by the venerable Kṣemarāja,  
who is supreme among the great Ācāryas devoted to Maheśvara,  
this concludes the twelfth chapter:
